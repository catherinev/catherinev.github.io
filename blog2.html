			<h3>SQL versus NoSQL</h3>
			<h4>Relational Databases</h4>
			<p>SQL has been around since the 1970s and is the language used to communicate with <em>relational databases</em>.  In a relational database, data is stored in tables that may be linked to each other. Each row (or record) of a table contains a data set representing a single item, and each column (or attribute) is a category that labels the elements in the rows.  SQL is used to update and retrieve data in relational databases.</p>
			<p>There are many advantages to using a relational database to store data.  For one, relational databases and SQL have been around for decades, so the technology is mature and many people have significant experience working with them.  They are also great for working with structured data (meaning that the attributes, or columns, being recorded aren't going to change) and datasets that aren't likely to suddenly expand. For instance, a patient or client management database, an HR database, and a library catalog can all be managed easily and effectively with a relational database. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week7_technical.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>

			<h3>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h3>

			<p>One reason I haven't felt particularly threatened by stereotypes is that I value personal achievement, improvement, and challenge above what other people think of me.  Thus, it's easy to disregard stereotypes in favor of more objective measures of my ability and potential.  </p>
			<p>I also strongly value the close relationships I have with others.  During times of stress, I find comfort in such relationships not because of any encouraging words or favorable opinions but rather because of the shared experiences, closeness, and comfort they provide.  I have been able to work through some of my most trying moments by helping others work through their own challenges and achieve their own successes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week7_cultural_blog.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>

			<h3>Object-Oriented Programming versus Functional Programming</h3>

			<h4>An example in Ruby</h4>
				<div class = "indent">
					<p>Before we talk about "object-oriented programming" versus "functional programming", let's look at an example.  Suppose I'd like to be able to find the perimeter of rectangles, circles, and triangles.  One way to acheive this is by using classes.  I can make classes for Rectangles, Circles, and Triangles and include a method within each one that will evaluate the perimeter of a particular instance of that class:</p>
					<code>
						<span class = "grey">1</span>  &nbsp;class Rectangle<br/>
						<span class = "grey">2</span>	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(length, width)<br/>
						<span class = "grey">3</span>	 	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@width = width<br/>
						<span class = "grey">4</span>		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@length = length<br/>
						<span class = "grey">5</span>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br/>

						<span class = "grey">6</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def perimeter<br/>
						<span class = "grey">7</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 * @width + 2 * @length<br/>
						<span class = "grey">8</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br/>
						<span class = "grey">9</span> &nbsp;end<br/><br/>
						<span class = "grey">10</span> class Circle<br/>
						<span class = "grey">11</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(radius)<br/>
						<span class = "grey">12</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@radius = radius<br/>
						<span class = "grey">13</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br/>

						<span class = "grey">14</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;def perimeter<br/>
						<span class = "grey">15</span>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 * 3.14 * @radius<br/>
						<span class = "grey">16</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br/>
						<span class = "grey">17</span> end<br/><br/>
						<span class = "grey">18</span> class Triangle<br/>
						<span class = "grey">19</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(side1, side2, side3)<br/>
						<span class = "grey">20</span>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@side1 = side1<br/>
						<span class = "grey">21</span>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@side2 = side2<br/>
						<span class = "grey">22</span>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@side3 = side3<br/>
						<span class = "grey">23</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br/>

						<span class = "grey">24</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;def perimeter<br/>
						<span class = "grey">25</span>		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@side1 + @side2 + @side3<br/>
						<span class = "grey">26</span>	&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br/>
						<span class = "grey">27</span> end<br/><br/>
						<span class = "grey">28</span> rect = Rectangle.new(2, 4) <br/>
						<span class = "grey">29</span> circ = Circle.new(3)<br/>
						<span class = "grey">30</span> tri = Triangle.new(1, 2, 3)<br/><br/>
						<span class = "grey">31</span> rect.perimeter<br/>
						<span class = "grey">32</span> circ.perimeter<br/>
						<span class = "grey">33</span> tri.perimeter<br/>

			<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<p>As a girl who is (and always has been) reasonably good at math and science, I have always been aware of the corresponding stereotype.  However, I can't think of a time it has affected my achievement, which may be one of the primary reasons I was able to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in math.  Throughout my schooling, it did upset me if someone prejudged my abilities because of my gender, but I've always  focused on my own standards for myself and have been able to find people (both guys and girls) who were eager to work with me.  I think I have a pretty good grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses, so I generally disregard someone's opinion of me unless they know me pretty well or have seen examples of my work.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week6_cultural_blog.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>
