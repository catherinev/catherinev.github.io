			<h3>Pairing and Group Work</h3>
			<p>Sophomore year of college, I took a math class called "Analysis".  I had already taken a course called "Intro to Analysis", but even so Analysis basically killed me.  The problem sets were designed to be particularly challenging, so most of the class would gather in the math building several times a week to try to solve the problems together.  It was pretty intense.  One night we all brought sleeping bags (and donuts) and spent the night.  Our professor found us all happily snuggled up on the classroom floor the following morning.  It was actually pretty awesome.  Don't lie; I know you are secretly jealous.
			</p>
			<p>Ever since that class, I have loved solving problems in a group.  It is truly remarkable how far beyond my comfort zone I can be pushed when put under pressure with other people who are equally motivated to solve problems.  I have found that discussing problems with people who approach them in completely different ways than I do is one of the most productive ways to make progress.  Moreover, the moments of success are magnified because I get to share them with other people.  Basically, everything about it rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week3_cultural_blog.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>

			<h3>What are the various ways to loop in Ruby and how can you decide which is best to use?</h3>
			<p>There are many ways to loop in Ruby.  Below are some of the more common options.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><codein>#each</codein>
						<code><grn>[collection]</grn>.each do |element| <br/>&emsp;&emsp;<grn>[some code]</grn><br/>end</code>
						<p>The <codein><grn>[collection]</grn></codein> is often an array but can also be a range, e.g. (1..100), or a hash.</p>
						<p><codein>#each</codein> is one of the most common ways to loop in Ruby.  In fact, if you can think of a way to execute your loop using <codein>#each</codein>, then <codein>#each</codein> is probably a pretty good option.  It's pretty versatile since it can be called on arrays, hashes, and ranges.</p>
						<p>Some related iterators are <codein>#each_index, #each_key,</codein> and <codein>#each_value,</codein> which loop over the indices of an array, the keys of a hash, and the values of a hash, respectively. </p>
					</li>
					<li><codein>#times</codein>
						<code><grn>[integer]</grn>.times do <br/><grn>&emsp;&emsp;[some code]</grn><br/>end</code><br/>
						<code><grn>[integer]</grn>.times do |index| <br/>&emsp;&emsp;<grn>[some code]</grn><br/>end</code>
						<codein>#times</codein> is a good option if you are trying to repeat the same block of code a set number of times.  For example, for a particular <codein>array</codein> you may want to execute the same block of code <codein>array.length</codein> number of times.

			<h3>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h3>
			<p>Before we talk about JavaScript, consider the following two questions.</p>
			<div class = "indent">
				<h4><b>Who are web developers these days?</b></h4>
				<p>Web developers can be, and are, just about anyone.  Many are people who have simply had an idea for an application or website and are trying implement it.  Such people come from an enormous variety of backgrounds.  Some may have programming experience, but many don't.  </p>
				<h4><b>What are web developers developing?</b></h4>
				<p>In the past, websites were largely static--they just presented information.  Not so anymore.  Think about smartphones, tablets, and how you interact with the web from your computer these days.  You can check the weather, play games, see how much money you have in your checking account, pay a bill, track your calorie intake, find out how soon the bus will arrive, buy a book, book a flight...</p>

			<h3>Serious Eats</h3>
			<p><a href = "http://www.seriouseats.com" target = "_blank">Serious Eats</a> is one of my favorite websites.  Like so many other websites, it has an excellent assortment of delicious recipes and reviews of restaurants all over the world. What sets it apart from other websites for me is primarily Kenji, one of the blog writers who has a background in science and writes excellent (and sometimes surprising) articles on the science behind his recipes.  There are other fantastic contributors to the website, but I especially enjoy reading about Kenji's experimental process and, at the same time, learning some food science.  Who doesn't want to know why their food tastes good?
			</p>
			<p>I find the user-experience to be quite enjoyable and the design to be streamlined and easy to look at.  Like any good food website, the homepage is full of photos of food, to which a user's eyes are immediately drawn.  The colors are light and undistracting, and there is an appropriate amount of contrast between text and backgrounds.  The website is set up like a blog, with the most recent posts first.  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/blog1.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>
