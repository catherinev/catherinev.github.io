    <h3><a href="/blog/4">Day 5</a></h3>
    <p>It's the end of the first week, and I made it through!  The week has been a bit of a roller coaster.  It started out great, but I got really stuck on Wednesday night and had a hard time getting started on Thursday morning.  On Thursday I also spent a large portion of the day working on projects independently--this is unusual for DBC since all other days of the week we are required to pair program on all challenges.  The independent work was pretty good, but we had some tough problems to work on in the afternoon and I got stuck.  To give my mind a break, I walked around to see what other people were working on, which was incredibly helpful and gave me the opportunity to talk with some of the members of my cohort I haven't worked with yet.  For the rest of the night, I worked with Tyler on the remaining projects, and I think we did an awesome job.</p>
			<p>We started really diving into rspec this week, which is a powerful tool but I don't feel that I have a full grasp on its capabilities.  We also covered recursion on Wednesday, which was totally awesome and super fun.  Today we are writing a program to solve Sudoku.  All the more advanced cohorts have warned us we'll be working on it for pretty much the whole weekend.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/4">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/25">Regular Expressions</a></h3>
    <h4>What are regular expressions?</h4>
			<p>Regular expressions, or RegExp, are used to search a string for a particular pattern of characters.  The search can be simple ("does the string contain 'Maru'?") or somewhat more complex ("does the string contain a 0 or 1 followed by any sequence of four numbers followed by lower-case letters?").</p>

			<h4>A simple example in Ruby</h4>
			<p>Suppose we want to know if a particular string contains 'Maru':   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/25">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/24">Reflections on Feedback</a></h3>
    <p>One aspect of DBC is that we regularly give and receive peer feedback after pair programming.  How well did we work together?  What could each of us have done differently to facilitate better communication and more effective collaboration?  What should we each be focusing on in the future?</p>
			<p>When I first started receiving feedback after pair programming sessions, I assumed that the most useful feedback I'd receive would be critical.  However, it has surprised me that some of the positive feedback I've received has also been quite valuable.  For example, the comment <em>"You said that you thought that you might talk to [sic] much during the sessions, but it made it easier to know when we both had a full understanding of the problem because of the conversation it created"</em> is helpful because it alleviates a concern I had about my working style.  Similarly, <em>"I love that you were always testing things in irb"</em> is helpful because it highlights an aspect of my work that I should continue doing.  The key to both of these comments is that they are specific and actionable.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/24">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/23">Sorting</a></h3>
    <p>Sorting is the ability to take a list (e.g., array, hash) and put the elements in order.  While it is a simple concept, there are many different ways to go about doing it.  If you were asked to manually order a list of randomly generated numbers, how would you do it?  Perhaps you'd consider doing something like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Look at the first number.  Since it's first, it is the smallest number so far.  Remember this number and move to the next number in your list.</li>
				<li>Is this number smaller than the number you have remembered?  If so, this number is now the smallest; forget the number that used to be smallest and remember this number instead.  Otherwise, just keep going.</li>
				<li>Move to the next element in your list and repeat step 2. Continue until you reach the end of the list.  By this time, you will have found the smallest number in your list.</li>
				<li>Take the smallest number out of the list and add it to a new, ordered list.</li>
				<li>Repeat steps 1-4 until your unordered list is empty.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This will certainly work, but it's <em>really inefficient</em>.  For each number in your list, you have to go through the entire (remaining) list and then add it to the new list.  Let's say you have a list of 10 numbers and it takes you 1 second to look at each element in the list (and decide if you should "remember" it).  Then, this algorithm will take you 10 seconds to find the smallest number, 9 seconds to find the next smallest, 8 seconds to find the next...for a total of 10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 55 seconds to put that list in order.  (Note: this assumes that step 4 takes 0 seconds.)  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/23">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
