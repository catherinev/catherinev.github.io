			<h3>Computer Science Education</h3>
			<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that the state of computer science and technology in K-12 education is somewhat alarming.  As more jobs are created and exciting innovations are made in computer science and technology, surprisingly few states are providing an adequate education for their students.  Only 17 states and the District of Columbia allow computer science courses to count towards core graduation requirements in either math or science.  NPR reports that only 10% of K-12 schools teach computer science.  And yet, ACM chair of Education Policy Committee Bobby Schnabel reports that by 2020, half of the jobs in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines will be in computing. It is predicted that within the next 10 years there will be approximately 1 million more jobs in the technology sector than there are computer science graduates.   How is that possible?  What is being done to address this  gap?</p>

			<p>There are programs throughout the country that aim to address this problem, but the change needs to come at a state and national level.  Current state standards are unacceptably lax.  While some states do have standards related explicitly to computer science, most have either too few or none at all.  And no state requires a computer science course as a condition of graduation.</p>

			<p>It's not an easy problem to solve.  Change is never easy, and schools legitimately complain of lack of resources--computer are expensive, and so are teachers who are equipped to teach computer programming.  So what can be done?  First, there needs to be adequate funding available to provide the necessary resources.  Some computer science education can be done without a computer, but schools will still need computers and teachers who are well trained.  To that end, states also need to provide teacher certification programs with reasonable standards.  And finally, states should incorporate computer science classes into their core standards, allowing them to count for graduation credit in either mathematics or science.</p>
