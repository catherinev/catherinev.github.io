			<h3>Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>
			<p>This week, our cohort watched a video lecture/Q&A given by Shereef Bishay, one of the founders of Dev Bootcamp.  The video gave some insight into the culture at DBC and outlined broad expectations for its students.  There were two key points made during the lecture that I'd especially like to highlight: that we are in charge of our own success and that we shouldn't compare ourselves to others.  Both of these points are valuable beyond just DBC, but I'll reflect on them just in the context of the upcoming program.  </p>

			<p>Shereef's metaphor of the "kitchen" (you make your food) versus "restaurant" (you order your food) was primarily valuable because it clearly outlined the expectations for us as students.  Knowing that we are expected to take charge of our own education makes it easier for us all to do so.  I find comfort knowing that I can make decisions to spend more or less time on topics depending on how valuable I think they will be.  In fact, throughout Phase 0 I have sometimes found myself spending less time on certain topics or assignments that seemed less valuable to my education.  Shereef's comments in the video make me feel more confident making those decisions.</p>

			<p>It was also nice to hear him acknowledge that DBC is still a work in progress.  Based on the video, it's clear that teachers encourage feedback from their students and are constantly reflecting on how the curriculum and overall program can be improved.  I especially thrive in open work environments that encourage constructive feedback.</p>

			<p>On a more personal note, the video helped me realize how important it will be for me to reach out to teachers and other students for feedback over the next few months.  As someone with very little programming experience, I find it difficult to evaluate my work.  And since we are not being "delivered" a pre-packaged program, I want to make sure I am getting the feedback I need to ensure that I develop good programming habits.  </p>

			<p>Finally, Shereef emphasized the importance of focusing on our own improvement instead of comparing ourselves to each other.  This is extremely important because of how closely we'll all be working.  It's somewhat comforting to hear--from someone who has quite a bit of perspective--that even though it may feel to us like certain people are a lot more advanced than others, to him we all have just about the same amount of inexperience.</p>


		<!-- 		<p>In some past jobs I've had, "working in the kitchen" was unwelcome; my job was simply to do my job and not to offer any opinion about what could be improved.  I've also worked at companies where outside suggestions were encouraged and appreciated.  Regardless of the mindset of the company, it can be challenging to figure out what that mindset is when joining the team.  </p>


			<p>I love baking -- the rewards are just so high.  It's always fun to make something new, and the result is usually delicious, even if something goes totally wrong.</p>
			<p>A lot of the reason I'm comfortable baking in the kitchen is because I've got a solid background in the fundamentals.  My mom taught me some of the fundamental principles of baking (creaming the butter and the sugar, not over-mixing the flour, etc).  It's much easier to be in the kitchen when you know some of the fundamentals.</p>
			Moreover, when I'm experimenting in the kitchen, I don't like experimenting on recipes that are already good.  Story of the bread. -->
			<!-- <p>My previous experiences with "kitchens".</p>
				My students
				It can be hard to be a beginner in a kitchen.
			<p>This video clarified things and changed my perspective.</p>
				It's helpful to know what mindset they are expecting us to have.

				I have been gravitating towards this mindset through phase 0, making decisions about what is and isn't worth spending more time on.

				I need feedback.
				At this point, it is in everyone's best interest to make the most of the experience.  

				I tend to have opinions and am not afraid to share them.  This isn't always welcomed in the workplace, especially from unseasoned employees.  It's great to know that DBC does welcome, even encourages, feedback.  I hope I have the time to share it.





			<p>As a teacher, I often told my students that how much they benefitted from my class would be proportional to how much effort they put in to it.  The point was largely to encourage motivated students to take charge of their own education.</p>
			<p>Based on what I have learned about Dev Bootcamp, it sounds like the same principle will apply; in fact, the effect may be even more pronounced than it was for my students.  </p> -->
