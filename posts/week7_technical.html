			<h3>SQL versus NoSQL</h3>
			<h4>Relational Databases</h4>
			<p>SQL has been around since the 1970s and is the language used to communicate with <em>relational databases</em>.  In a relational database, data is stored in tables that may be linked to each other. Each row (or record) of a table contains a data set representing a single item, and each column (or attribute) is a category that labels the elements in the rows.  SQL is used to update and retrieve data in relational databases.</p>
			<p>There are many advantages to using a relational database to store data.  For one, relational databases and SQL have been around for decades, so the technology is mature and many people have significant experience working with them.  They are also great for working with structured data (meaning that the attributes, or columns, being recorded aren't going to change) and datasets that aren't likely to suddenly expand. For instance, a patient or client management database, an HR database, and a library catalog can all be managed easily and effectively with a relational database.</p>
			<p>However, relational databases are not well-suited to manage all data collections.  It is computationally expensive  to search a relational database with hundreds of thousands of tables; in other words, relational databases with sufficiently large amounts of complicated data are inefficient.  Moreover, it can be difficult to manage complex and dynamic data with a relational database. We mentioned that relational databases are great for working with "structured" data, but what if at the onset of a project you don't know exactly what attributes you want to collect for a given record?  For example, consider storing  website content in a database.  Each website has structure, but there is no pre-described structure followed by all websites. This data doesn't fit well in a relational database.</p>
			<h4>Non-relational Databases</h4>
			<p>A non-relational, or NoSQL ("Not only SQL"), database is just that: it's a database that doesn't use relations (tables) to store data.  There are several different types of NoSQL databases including key-value stores, wide-column stores, document databases, and graph stores. All types are designed to be efficient and can easily handle lots of complex, unstructured data.  In the past few years, NoSQL databases have gotten a lot of press because large companies like Google, Twitter, Amazon, and Facebook have all started using them. </p>
			<p>The primary benefit of NoSQL databases is that they can manage large amounts of complex data very efficiently.  The speed of a NoSQL database can be improved by adding more servers, so NoSQL databases are easy to scale up quickly.  The same cannot be said of relational databases; in fact, the performance of a relational database can actually suffer when multiple servers are used (there are ways to get around this, but they aren't easy).  Moreover, NoSQL databases can handle both structured and unstructured data and thus are more flexible.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, to achieve such excellent performance with so much data, some functionality is sacrificed.  For example, a NoSQL database may not always be <em>consistent</em>, meaning that some of the data might not be up-to-date all the time.  For example, suppose someone buys a book on Amazon.  As soon as the book is purchased, Amazon's inventory decreases by 1.  But unless its database is consistent, the database isn't guaranteed to reflect the change in inventory immediately.  Another disadvantage is that NoSQL is less standardized and less popular than relational databases, which can make it harder to work with and troubleshoot.</p>
			<h4>In conclusion</h4>
			<p>The best choice for database structure depends on the project.  But for now, relational databases are the more popular option for the average project.  Most companies don't have very large, dynamically changing datasets that require superb performance. Therefore, they don't benefit from the ways in which non-relational databases outperform relational ones, which work well and are more familiar.</p>
