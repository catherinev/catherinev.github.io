			<h3>Day 5</h3>
			<p>It's the end of the first week, and I made it through!  The week has been a bit of a roller coaster.  It started out great, but I got really stuck on Wednesday night and had a hard time getting started on Thursday morning.  On Thursday I also spent a large portion of the day working on projects independently--this is unusual for DBC since all other days of the week we are required to pair program on all challenges.  The independent work was pretty good, but we had some tough problems to work on in the afternoon and I got stuck.  To give my mind a break, I walked around to see what other people were working on, which was incredibly helpful and gave me the opportunity to talk with some of the members of my cohort I haven't worked with yet.  For the rest of the night, I worked with Tyler on the remaining projects, and I think we did an awesome job.</p>
			<p>We started really diving into rspec this week, which is a powerful tool but I don't feel that I have a full grasp on its capabilities.  We also covered recursion on Wednesday, which was totally awesome and super fun.  Today we are writing a program to solve Sudoku.  All the more advanced cohorts have warned us we'll be working on it for pretty much the whole weekend.</p>
			<p>Overall it's been a great week and I feel like I've learned so much.  I'm a bit exhausted and hope I have a chance to sleep some this weekend.  My cohort is amazing--everyone I've worked with has been so helpful and equally invested in learning.  Looking forward to Sudoku today!</p>
