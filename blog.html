			<h3>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h3>
			<p>Before we talk about JavaScript, consider the following two questions.</p>
			<div class = "indent">
				<h4><b>Who are web developers these days?</b></h4>
				<p>Web developers can be, and are, just about anyone.  Many are people who have simply had an idea for an application or website and are trying implement it.  Such people come from an enormous variety of backgrounds.  Some may have programming experience, but many don't.  </p>
				<h4><b>What are web developers developing?</b></h4>
				<p>In the past, websites were largely static--they just presented information.  Not so anymore.  Think about smartphones, tablets, and how you interact with the web from your computer these days.  You can check the weather, play games, see how much money you have in your checking account, pay a bill, track your calorie intake, find out how soon the bus will arrive, buy a book, book a flight...</p>
				<p>There are some common features among these examples.  Information on websites and in web apps often changes frequently--the weather ... read more </p>

			<h3>Serious Eats</h3>
			<p><a href = "http://www.seriouseats.com" target = "_blank">Serious Eats</a> is one of my favorite websites.  Like so many other websites, it has an excellent assortment of delicious recipes and reviews of restaurants all over the world. What sets it apart from other websites for me is primarily Kenji, one of the blog writers who has a background in science and writes excellent (and sometimes surprising) articles on the science behind his recipes.  There are other fantastic contributors to the website, but I especially enjoy reading about Kenji's experimental process and, at the same time, learning some food science.  Who doesn't want to know why their food tastes good?
			</p>
			<p>I find the user-experience to be quite enjoyable and the design to be streamlined and easy to look at.  Like any good food website, the homepage is full of photos of food, to which a user's eyes are immediately drawn.  The colors are light and undistracting, and there is an appropriate amount of contrast between text and backgrounds.  The website is set up like a blog, with the most recent posts first.  </p>

			<p>Moreover, the use of tags makes it easier to navigate such a large website; whenever I want to find Kenji's latest posts, I check to see if he's posted anything on ... <a href = "">read more</a></p>
