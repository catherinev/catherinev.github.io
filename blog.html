			<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
			<h4>What are regular expressions?</h4>
			<p>Regular expressions, or RegExp, are used to search a string for a particular pattern of characters.  The search can be simple ("does the string contain 'Maru'?") or somewhat more complex ("does the string contain a 0 or 1 followed by any sequence of four numbers followed by lower-case letters?").</p>

			<h4>A simple example in Ruby</h4>
			<p>Suppose we want to know if a particular string contains 'Maru': </p>

			<code>
				/Maru/ =~ 'hello Maru' <em> => 6</em><br/>
				 'hello Maru' =~ /Maru/ <em> => 6</em><br/>
				 'I love a box' =~ /Maru/ <em> => nil</em><br/>
				 /maru/ =~ 'hello Maru' <em> => nil</em><br/>
			</code>

			<h3>Reflections on Feedback</h3>
			<p>One aspect of DBC is that we regularly give and receive peer feedback after pair programming.  How well did we work together?  What could each of us have done differently to facilitate better communication and more effective collaboration?  What should we each be focusing on in the future?</p>
			<p>When I first started receiving feedback after pair programming sessions, I assumed that the most useful feedback I'd receive would be critical.  However, it has surprised me that some of the positive feedback I've received has also been quite valuable.  For example, the comment <em>"You said that you thought that you might talk to [sic] much during the sessions, but it made it easier to know when we both had a full understanding of the problem because of the conversation it created"</em> is helpful because it alleviates a concern I had about my working style.  Similarly, <em>"I love that you were always testing things in irb"</em> is helpful because it highlights an aspect of my work that I should continue doing.  The key to both of these comments is that they are specific and actionable. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week9_cultural_blog.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>

			<h3>Sorting</h3>
			<p>Sorting is the ability to take a list (e.g., array, hash) and put the elements in order.  While it is a simple concept, there are many different ways to go about doing it.  If you were asked to manually order a list of randomly generated numbers, how would you do it?  Perhaps you'd consider doing something like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Look at the first number.  Since it's first, it is the smallest number so far.  Remember this number and move to the next number in your list.</li>
				<li>Is this number smaller than the number you have remembered?  If so, this number is now the smallest; forget the number that used to be smallest and remember this number instead.  Otherwise, just keep going.</li>
				<li>Move to the next element in your list and repeat step 2. Continue until you reach the end of the list.  By this time, you will have found the smallest number in your list.</li>
				<li>Take the smallest number out of the list and add it to a new, ordered list.</li>
				<li>Repeat steps 1-4 until your unordered list is empty.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This will certainly work, but it's <em>really inefficient</em>.  For each number in your list, you have to go through the entire (remaining) list and then add it to the new list.  Let's say you have a list of 10 numbers and it takes you 1 second to look at each element in the list (and decide if you should "remember" it).  Then, this algorithm will take you 10 seconds to find the smallest number, 9 seconds to find the next smallest, 8 seconds to find the next...for a total of 10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 55 seconds to put that list in order.  (Note: this assumes that step 4 takes 0 seconds.)

			<h3>Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>
			<p>This week, our cohort watched a video lecture/Q&A given by Shereef Bishay, one of the founders of Dev Bootcamp.  The video gave some insight into the culture at DBC and outlined broad expectations for its students.  There were two key points made during the lecture that particularly resonated with me: that each of us is in charge of our own success and that we shouldn't compare ourselves to others.  Both of these points are valuable beyond just DBC, but I'll reflect on them just in the context of the upcoming program.  </p>

			<p>Shereef's metaphor of the "kitchen" (you make your food) versus "restaurant" (you order your food) was primarily valuable because it clearly outlined the expectations for us as students.  Knowing that we are expected to take charge of our own education makes it easier for us all to do so.  I find comfort knowing that I can make decisions to spend more or less time on topics depending on how valuable I think they will be.  In fact, during Phase 0 I have sometimes found myself spending less time on certain topics or assignments that seemed less valuable to my education.  Shereef's comments in the video make me feel more confident making those decisions. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week8_cultural_blog.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>
