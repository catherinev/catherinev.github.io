			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div id = "pic"><img src = "img.jpg" alt = "me!"></div>
			<div id = "bio"><p>I was born in Washington DC, grew up in Connecticut, went to college in Southern California, and have been in Chicago for the past 5 years.</p>
			<p>I have always tutored/taught mathematics, although I didn't actually find math to be all that interesting until college.  As such, I became interested in math education, specifically the standard K-12 curriculum and the ideology behind it.</p> 
			<p>More recently, I have become interested in CS education and why so few students are exposed to even the basics before college.</p>
			<p>Here is a link to my blog post from Week 1: <a href = "blog.html">blog</a>
