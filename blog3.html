			<h3>Classes in Ruby</h3>
			<p><em>Classes</em> are a natural way to group similar types of objects in Ruby.  For example, <codein>Array</codein> is a class.  There are two ways to define a new object in the class <codein>Array</codein>:
				<code>
				arr_1 = Array.new </br>
				arr_1[0] = "Hello"</br>
				arr_1[1] = "world"</br>
				arr_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
				</code>
			<codein>arr_1</codein> has been defined using constructor notation and <codein>arr_2</codein> has been defined using literal notation, but both are the same type of object.  <codein>arr_1</codein> and <codein>arr_2</codein> are called <em>instances</em> of the class <codein>Array</codein>.  So a class is a category, and an instance is a particular object that falls into that category.  Other examples of classes are <codein>String, Fixnum, Float,</codein> and <codein>Hash</codein>.  </p> 

			<p>So why are classes helpful?  Because we often want to know similar things or perform similar tasks on objects in the same class.  Each class has associated <em>methods</em> that do something to an instance of the class. For example, <codein>#length, #each,</codein> and <codein>#sort</codein> are all methods associated with the class <codein>Array</codein>.  Similarly, <codein>#length, #downcase,</codein> and <codein>#each_char</codein> are all methods associated with the class <codein>String</codein>.  Each of these methods can be called on any instance of the associated class.  (Note that some methods are associated with more than one class.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week5_technical.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>

			<h3>Computer Science Education</h3>
			<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that the state of computer science and technology in K-12 education is somewhat alarming.  As more jobs are created and exciting innovations are made in computer science and technology, surprisingly few states are providing an adequate education for their students.  Only 17 states and the District of Columbia allow computer science courses to count towards core graduation requirements in either math or science.  NPR reports that only 10% of K-12 schools teach computer science.  And yet, ACM chair of Education Policy Committee Bobby Schnabel reports that by 2020, half of the jobs in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines will be in computing. It is predicted that within the next 10 years there will be approximately 1 million more jobs in the technology sector than there are computer science graduates.   How is that possible?  What is being done to address this  gap?</p>

			<p>There are programs throughout the country that aim to address this problem, but the change needs to come at a state and national level.  Current state standards are unacceptably lax.  While some states do have standards related explicitly to computer science, most have either too few or none at all.  And no state requires a computer science course as a condition of graduation.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week5_cultural_blog.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>

			<h3>Dealing with Conflict</h3>
			<p>I have been a tutor for many years.  A few years ago, there was an  emotional conflict between me and a parent of one of my students.  We will call the student Russell and the parent Jason.</p>
			<p>I had a regular weekly tutoring appointment with Russell.  However, one week he had a scheduling conflict so we rescheduled.  That week, I arrived at the family's home at the time Jason and I had discussed.  Upon arrival, it quickly became clear that Jason had forgotten about our appointment and that Russell was not home.  I waited in the hallway for 15-20 minutes while Jason tried to get in touch with Russell.  Eventually, Jason determined that Russell was still at school taking a history test, so he would not be able to meet for tutoring.  Jason then asked if he would be charged for the tutoring session, and I told them they would be. Jason became extremely upset.  I reminded him that that the office I work for has a 24-hour cancelation policy and that he was welcome to discuss any questions he had about the policy with the directors at the office.  Jason was still upset and said something to the effect of "If I have to pay for your time, then I'm going to use that time.  Teach me the lesson you had planned for Russell." So I did.  About 45 minutes later, Russell got home and I spent the remaining part of our session teaching Russell.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href = "posts/week4_cultural_blog.html" class = "rm"> read more&nbsp;&raquo; </a></p>

			<h3><codein>#map</codein> in Ruby</h3>
			<p>The <codein>#map</codein> method in Ruby can used to transform arrays, hashes, and ranges by calling a block of code on each element and pushing each result to a new array.  So, regardless of the class of the input (array, hash, or range), the output is a new array.  
			</p>

			<code>
				input.map { |item| block } <em>=> output_array</em>
			</code>
			<p>You can interpret this syntax as follows.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><codein>input</codein> is an array, hash, or range.</li>
				<li><codein>item</codein> represents the elements in <codein>input</codein> that are being iterated over.  In an array/range, <codein>item</codein> represents each element; in a hash, <codein>item</codein> represents the key/value pair.</li>
				<li><codein>block</codein> is the block of code that will be performed on each element in <codein>input</codein>.  The result of this block is pushed to the <codein>output_array</codein>.</li>
				<li><codein>output_array</codein> is an array that contains the values returned by the block for each of the elements in <codein>input</codein>.</li>
