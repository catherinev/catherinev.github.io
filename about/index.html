    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a software engineer at <a href="http://www.narrativescience.com">Narrative Science</a>.  I have a masters degree in math from the University of Illinois at Chicago and graduated from <a href = "http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> in the summer of 2014.  For more than 10 years, I taught math to students of all ages and levels.  I now enjoy applying my communications, management, and mentorship skills to software development projects.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I like to eat and experiment with food. I especially like cheese and chocolate (but not together).  Sometimes I run, but not very far.  I also like to make things like quilts.</p>

    <h3>About this site</h3>
    <p>This website is about me and my ongoing journey as I learn to program and develop awesome software.
