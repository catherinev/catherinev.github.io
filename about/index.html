    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I'm a former mathematician and now a software engineer working at <a href="http://www.narrativescience.com">Narrative Science</a>.  Our platform, <a href="https://www.narrativescience.com/quill">Quill</a>, takes structured data and turns it into natural language; for example, we convert baseball statistics into engaging articles about the games.  I started on the client team where I wrote self-contained applications that extracted key insights from client data.  Now I've transitioned to the team that is rebuilding Quill from the ground up.</p>

    <p>I have a masters degree in math from the University of Illinois at Chicago.  For more than 10 years, I taught math to students of all ages and levels.  I  enjoy applying a lifetime of technical, communications, and management skills to software development.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I like to eat and experiment with food. I especially like cheese and chocolate (but not together).  Sometimes I run, but not very far.  I also like to make things like quilts.</p>
