    <h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>
    <h3>Quest Maker (in progress)</h3>
    <h4>http://catherinev.pythonanywhere.com/</h4>
    <p>Inspired by the <a href="http://home.insightbb.com/~eowynchallenge/Walk/walk.html">Walk to Rivendell Challenge</a>, I launched this hobby project to make exercise more rewarding by enabling users to easily create and participate in quests with their friends. The app integrates with the Fitbit API so daily progress is updated automatically.</p>
    <h3>Don't Park There Chicago</h3>
    <p>A Rails app that informs users of street sweeping dates in their areas.  I was part of a team of 5 people who built the application in less than 8 days.  The app uses geospatial data about Chicago's 888 street sweeping regions to render an interactive Leaflet map. Users may sign up for email notifications (powered by Mandrill) or text notifications (powered by Twilio) to avoid being ticketed.  The site is responsive and optimized for use on computers, smartphones, and other mobile devices.</p>
