				<p>I was born in Washington DC, grew up in Connecticut, went to college in Southern California, and have been in Chicago for the past 5 years.</p>

				<p>I have always tutored/taught mathematics, although I didn't actually find math to be all that interesting until college.  As such, I became interested in math education, specifically the standard K-12 curriculum and the ideology behind it.</p> 
			
				<p>More recently, I have become interested in CS education and why so few students are exposed to even the basics before college.</p>
