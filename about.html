				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>I have a masters degree in math and am learning to be a web developer at Dev Bootcamp.  In my spare time, I like to eat and experiment with food. I especially like cheese and chocolate (but not together).  Sometimes I run, but not very far.  I also like to make things, like quilts.</p>

				<p>For more than 10 years, I have taught math to students of all ages and levels.  I look forward to applying some of my communications, management, and mentorship skills to web development projects.</p>

				<p>This website is about me and my ongoing journey as I learn to program and develop awesome web products.</p>

				<h3>About this site</h3>
				<p>This site was designed and written by me.  You are welcome to copy and use the design elements of this website, but please credit me if you do so.</p>
