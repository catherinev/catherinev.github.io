  <h3>Reflections on Feedback</h3>
  <p>One aspect of DBC is that we regularly give and receive peer feedback after pair programming. How well did we work together? What could each of us have done differently to facilitate better communication and more effective collaboration? What should we each be focusing on in the future?</p>
    <p>When I first started receiving feedback after pair programming sessions, I assumed that the most useful feedback I'd receive would be critical. However, it has surprised me that some of the positive feedback I've received has also been quite valuable. For example, the comment
        <em>"You said that you thought that you might talk to [sic] much during the sessions, but it made it easier to know when we both had a full understanding of the problem because of the conversation it created"</em>is helpful because it alleviates a concern I had about my working style. Similarly,
        <em>"I love that you were always testing things in irb"</em>is helpful because it highlights an aspect of my work that I should continue doing. The key to both of these comments is that they are specific and actionable.</p>

    <p>The critical feedback I've received has also been helpful when it's specific and actionable. For example,
        <em>"It's definitely OK to be more forward when you are driving and the navigator is stuck"</em>is a helpful comment because I'm often unsure how to react in this situation. Similarly, the comment
        <em>"...when we are going through and correcting errors that I may have made, it would be helpful if you took a moment to explain why something needed to be added or deleted in a bit more detail, so that the concept was equally as clear as the solution"</em>is helpful because I didn't realize I was moving through the corrections too quickly. The bottom line is that I've realized it's possible for feedback to be specific and actionable regardless of whether it is critical.</p>

    <p>Next week we start Phase 1, which means we will all be on-site and giving each other feedback in-person. I'm excited for the opportunity to practice giving and receiving feedback live, which can be tough sometimes but is an important lifelong skill. I always try to let the primary goal of giving feedback guide how I give and receive it: feedback isn't an opportunity to let out frustrations; it's a chance to improve and help others improve. As long as we are all honest and stick to the facts (read: avoid emotions), I think we will all benefit a ton from open communication and feedback channels.</p>
