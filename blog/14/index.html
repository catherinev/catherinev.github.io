  <h3>Dealing with Conflict</h3>
  <p>I have been a tutor for many years.  A few years ago, there was an  emotional conflict between me and a parent of one of my students.  We will call the student Russell and the parent Jason.</p>
			<p>I had a regular weekly tutoring appointment with Russell.  However, one week he had a scheduling conflict so we rescheduled.  That week, I arrived at the family's home at the time Jason and I had discussed.  Upon arrival, it quickly became clear that Jason had forgotten about our appointment and that Russell was not home.  I waited in the hallway for 15-20 minutes while Jason tried to get in touch with Russell.  Eventually, Jason determined that Russell was still at school taking a history test, so he would not be able to meet for tutoring.  Jason then asked if he would be charged for the tutoring session, and I told them they would be. Jason became extremely upset.  I reminded him that that the office I work for has a 24-hour cancelation policy and that he was welcome to discuss any questions he had about the policy with the directors at the office.  Jason was still upset and said something to the effect of "If I have to pay for your time, then I'm going to use that time.  Teach me the lesson you had planned for Russell." So I did.  About 45 minutes later, Russell got home and I spent the remaining part of our session teaching Russell.</p>
			<p>The situation made me feel upset because Jason did not act as if my time was valuable.  It also made me feel uncomfortable because I was asked to teach a lesson that had been designed for a high school student to an adult.</p>
			<p>I did not show my emotions during the exchange, and I think that prevented the situation from escalating even more than it did. However, in some ways my actions exacerbated the situation -- I could have chosen to not bill for the session.  But the only reason to take that avenue would have been to avoid emotional conflict, and it would have set a precedent that I may have regretted.  Taking actions just to avoid emotional conflict is not always the best choice, especially when the conflict involves people with whom you have a long-term relationship.</p>
			<p>Because of the emotional toll the conflict took on me, I spent time talking to my superiors at the office and reflecting on how to handle such situations gracefullly.  Even after reflection, it's not obvious to me what the absolute best way to handle such situations is.  What I have determined is that it's important to be <b>honest, direct, unemotional,</b> and <b>prepared</b>.  If I could go back, I would not have taught Jason the lesson I had planned for Russell.  Instead, I would have further emphasized that the cancelation policy is an office policy and that Jason was welcome to call the office with any questions.  I would also have said that I am contractually bound to teach students, not parents.</p>
			<p>I also took some immediate actions to prevent such situations in the future.  I now send out reminder emails 48 hours in advance of all tutoring sessions.  I also email all my clients every fall to reiterate the 24-hour cancelation policy. </p>
			<p>Since reflecting on my experience with Jason and Russell, I have felt more comfortable dealing with conflict.  I now train tutors at the same company and have developed an orientation that includes a segment on handling emotional conflicts with clients.  One of the goals is to help tutors develop habits that avoid such conflict.  Another is to give tutors strategies for handling conflict if it does occur --  our relationships with our clients are very important, so tutors must be able to resolve conflict in a way that does not further upset the client.  Sometimes it's impossible to resolve a conflict without evoking any emotional response, but I've found that I can decrease it if I'm honest, direct, unemotional, and prepared.</p>
