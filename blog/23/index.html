  <h3>My First Rails App!</h3>
  <p>During phase 2, we used a framework called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_(software)">Sinatra</a>, which is a lightweight version of Rails. Since it doesn't handle as many of the details as Rails does, it's a great way to get familiar with what is happening behind the scenes before jumping into Rails.</p>

    <p>I'm starting Phase 3 next week, so in preparation we learned Rails this weekend. The core assignment was to build a blog application. This is what I ended up with: <a href="http://theawesomeblogger.herokuapp.com/">The Awesome Blogger</a>. If you want to see a blog without logging in, check out <a href="http://theawesomeblogger.herokuapp.com/users/1/articles">this link</a>. You'll find the posts to be thrilling. If you are interested in the source code for the site, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/catherinev/blog-app">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The app is based on a blogger app I built in Sinatra during phase 2 (which explains the award-worthy design and color scheme
        <img src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/visualpharm/ios7v2/256/Emoticons-Wink-icon.png" style="height: 1em">). To build it, I relied heavily on the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting Started with Rails</a> guide and Michael Hartl's <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> as references, both of which I found to be very helpful.</p>

    <p>There are many aspects of this app that could be better, perhaps most obviously the design. Ajax would make comment-posting a better experience, as well as various other actions on the site. Also, at the moment anyone can post a comment; ultimately, it would probably be better if a user had to be signed in to leave a comment. Paginating would also be great.</p>

    <p>There are still some lingering issues. For example, my error messages work just fine in development but aren't working in production. Hmmm. Also, I did not use TDD. That's my goal for my next app -- I'm pretty sure we're going to get into TDD this week.</p>

    <p>Still, I'm pretty happy with it as a first project!</p>

    <p style="font-size: 0.9em">Note: I am treating this app as a toy. You are welcome to play with it, but I may drop the database as I continue to tinker around. That means anything you create has a chance of being lost. Also, it's currently being hosted on Heroku with one dyno, which means it may take a little while to fire up after you click the link. If you find any bugs, let me know!</p>
