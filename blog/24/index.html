  <h3>Don't Park There Chicago</h3>
  <p>I officially graduated from DBC just over a week ago.  It was so exciting!</p>
  <p>For the last 8 days of bootcamp, everyone works on a final project.  I was part of a team with 5 awesome people, and we built an app that I think came out pretty great: <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a>.  The app informs users of street sweeping dates in their areas and uses geospatial data about Chicago's 888 street sweeping regions to render an interactive Leaflet map.  Users may also sign up for email notifications (powered by Mandrill) or text notifications (powered by Twilio) to avoid being ticketed.</p>

  <p>This project was, honestly, a blast.  On day 1, we all agreed on expectations about work ethic, discussed how we would settle any future disagreements, and set up an agile workflow and scrum board.  Taking the time to have this conversation upfront was key to our success as a team.  We had very few issues working together, and each small success was felt by all team members.  Anytime a group member was feeling discouraged or stuck on a problem, there was always someone else willing to pair and work through the issue.  Seriously, it was awesome.  Go team!</p>
  <h4>Challenges</h4>
  <p>The project presented some unexpected challenges that were incredibly rewarding to overcome.  Some of the challenges -- setting up email notifications, rendering polygons on a Leaflet map, adapting the site for mobile devices, setting up Devise properly -- were primarily solved by other members of my group. In my next few blog posts, I'll reflect on two of the challenges I spent the most time solving: setting up/optimizing the database and optimizing the core design of the site.</p>
