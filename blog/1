  <h3>Serious Eats</h3>
  <p><a href="http://www.seriouseats.com" target="_blank">Serious Eats</a> is one of my favorite websites. Like so many other websites, it has an excellent assortment of delicious recipes and reviews of restaurants all over the world. What sets it apart from other websites for me is primarily Kenji, one of the blog writers who has a background in science and writes excellent (and sometimes surprising) articles on the science behind his recipes. There are other fantastic contributors to the website, but I especially enjoy reading about Kenji's experimental process and, at the same time, learning some food science. Who doesn't want to know why their food tastes good?
    </p>
    <p>I find the user-experience to be quite enjoyable and the design to be streamlined and easy to look at. Like any good food website, the homepage is full of photos of food, to which a user's eyes are immediately drawn. The colors are light and undistracting, and there is an appropriate amount of contrast between text and backgrounds. The website is set up like a blog, with the most recent posts first.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the use of tags makes it easier to navigate such a large website; whenever I want to find Kenji's latest posts, I check to see if he's posted anything on "The Food Lab", which he usually has, and then click on his name to get all his posts.</p>

    <p>The homepage makes good use of negative space, but some of the other pages are a bit cluttered with advertisements and "suggestions". For example, the recipes page could use more negative space. The organization on this page is also somewhat lacking. Although the website as a whole is organized in reverse-chronological order (like a blog), I'm not conviced this is the best organization for the "Recipes" page. The flow on this page could be improved.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.usaa.com" target="_blank">USAA</a> offers a number of services--banking, insurance, etc--and I have a few accounts with them, so I'm on the website pretty regularly. They tend to do a pretty good job with technology and customer service across the board, and in the past couple of years I have noticed that the user experience on their website has been better than that of other banking websites I use (and they are always improving!).</p>
    <p>The website is easy to read. The homepage has plenty of negative space (a quality that I've noticed is lacking on some other banking websites) and is organized on a grid. Throughout the site, the fonts are all sans serif. The whole website uses few colors other than blue, green, white, and black -- simple and effective in this case. The overall design of the site is very organized, which helps with flow and is appropriate for such a "serious" website.</p>
    <p>Once you log into your account, all the information is organized into two columns below the navigation bar: 1 "primary" column with a summary of information about your accounts and a "secondary" column on the right with some useful shortcuts. The navigation bar at the top of the page is the same on each page, which makes it easy to navigate the site. A few of the pages I check (such as "documents") are a bit tough to find, but aside from that the design is very user friendly and easy to look at.</p>
    <p>Finally, a few comments on utility. In the past year or so, USAA has added several features that have enhanced overall utility, which was pretty good to begin with. In addition to being able to view accounts and do stuff with them (e.g., file an insurance claim, pay a bill), you can now track how you spend money, set goals, and plan for the future. While these are unnecessary additions, they add value for many users.</p>

    <p>I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a> on a daily basis. I buy a ton of stuff from them, everything ranging from hair dye to shoes to books to food. In addition, I have Amazon Prime and use the included streaming to watch TV shows (like Dr. Who!) and movies. Thus, I have a fair amount of experience with the user interface, performance, and how they've changed in the past few years.</p>
    <p>Of the websites I looked at, Amazon's design is the busiest and most cluttered. There are lots of colors, fonts, and advertisements/suggestions all trying to attract my attention. To be fair, Amazon is an enormous website and is trying to deliver the information it has as effectively as possible. Moreover, they are trying to sell you stuff! So it's unsurprising that there's quite a bit going on.</p>
    <p>Considering how much "stuff" is on the homepage, the flow is pretty good. Despite the number of colors on the site, it does a good job of providing contrast for the most important links and buttons (like "add to cart" and "watch now"). This use of color helps separate the most important information from the rest of the page.</p>
    <p>Navigation is difficult, and because of the size of the site it's a difficult problem to solve. Every time I've had to return something to them, I have had to search pretty hard to figure out how to actually initiate the process (is that intentional Amazon...?). The search tool works well, so if you know what you want it's usually pretty easy to find. But it's not an easy site to browse. For example, suppose I'm looking for a pair of 3" silver heels, but I haven't decided exactly what type of heel (pump, sandal, boot). It's easy enough to navigate to "women's shoes" and filter by color and heel height (although honestly...it's not that easy). But then I get all these sneaker shoes as well. How do I get rid of those? Not sure. There might be a way, but it's not obvious to me.</p>
    <p>Finally, the streaming has improved but is still buggy, i.e. the performance isn't the best. There are lags and pauses. It is much easier to navigate to my "watchlist" than it used to be, but I'm still adjusting to recent changes (something important to consider! Changing a heavily used website requires many users to adjust, which they may not be happy about in the short term).</p>
