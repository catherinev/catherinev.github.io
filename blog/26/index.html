  <h3>Don't Park There Chicago: the design</h3>
  <h4>See <a href = "/blog/24/">this post</a> for more background on the Don't Park There Chicago</h4>
  <p>The overall design of <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a> went through 3 distinct phases.  The first looked like this:</p>
  <h4 style = "text-align:center">Design 1</h4>
  <img src="/assets/dptc1.png" style="width: 70%; margin: 0 15% 2% 15%">
  <p>It's pretty snazzy looking.  However, it had a few problems.  The first was that the background picture was a large file that took a while to load.  We could probably have decreased the size of the file, but there was a bigger problem: the design impeded the functionality of the site.  At the bottom of the page was a super cool map and more information about street sweeping -- information that is valuable to many users.  Users must either scroll down or click the down arrow button to get that information.  But user testing revealed that almost no one scrolled or clicked the button.  We needed to redesign the site with functionality in mind.</p>
  <p>As a group, we did some research into single-purpose websites, most notably weather website applications.  Weather applications are similar to Don't Park There Chicago in that people generally visit them for one reason -- to find out the weather.  Maybe users want to get the forecast for the next few days or for a different location, but often they just want to know the forecast for their current location in the immediate future.  Based on our research, we concluded the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>White space is important.</li>
    <li>Too much text/information is distracting.</li>
    <li>If the purpose of visiting the site is to get the answer to one question, the answer to that question should be immediate and stand out on the page.</li>
    <li>If we want more information, it should be easy to find.</li>
    <li>We prefer having to click as few times as possible (none is ideal).</li>
    <li>Visually pleasing/interactive features are an added bonus that make us explore the site further.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With that in mind, we created the following two designs:</p>
  <h4 style = "text-align:center">Design 2</h4>
  <img src="/assets/dptc3.png" style="width: 70%; margin: 0 15% 2% 15%">
  <h4 style = "text-align:center">Design 3</h4>
  <img src="/assets/dptc2.png" style="width: 70%; margin: 0 15% 2% 15%">
  <p>After discussing each of these options as a group, we agreed that Design 3 was a bit too map-heavy and provided too much information at once.  On the other hand, the nav bar at the top of Design 2 and the extra whitespace throughout the page made the most important information jump off the page while still being a visually attactive design.</p>

  <p>And so, Design 2 it was!</p>
