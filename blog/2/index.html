        <p>Because many of my values are tightly connected to one another, I had a hard time picking just one word for this response. I settled on "commitment" because ultimately, my sense of accomplishment, pride, enthusiasm, and excitment are always a result of just how committed I have been to begin with. Commitment is important to me because of the sense of connection it implies. I have been committed to other people through friendship and love; I have been committed to solving tough problems; I have been committed to achieving excellent results at work. For all of these examples, there is a deep sense of connection and engagement either with other people, problems, or goals. No matter the context, my sense of achievement and pride is a direct result of how invested I've been rather than the outcome itself.</p>
        <p>While commitment is one of the foremost qualities that comes to mind when considering my happiest and proudest moments, it is also a word that comes to mind when I considering my most frustrating and unhappy moments. It is extremely discouraging, and sometimes downright miserable, when you are committed to a person, a problem, or a challenge that for whatever reason things don't work out as you are hoping or expecting.</p>

        <p>The last real topic that someone asked for my advice on was about how to be creative and productive in an unsupportive work environment.</p>
