    <h3><a href="/blog/13/">Dealing with Conflict</a></h3>
    <p>I have been a tutor for many years. A few years ago, there was an emotional conflict between me and a parent of one of my students. We will call the student Russell and the parent Jason.</p>
    <p>I had a regular weekly tutoring appointment with Russell. However, one week he had a scheduling conflict so we rescheduled. That week, I arrived at the family's home at the time Jason and I had discussed. Upon arrival, it quickly became clear that Jason had forgotten about our appointment and that Russell was not home. I waited in the hallway for 15-20 minutes while Jason tried to get in touch with Russell. Eventually, Jason determined that Russell was still at school taking a history test, so he would not be able to meet for tutoring. Jason then asked if he would be charged for the tutoring session, and I told them they would be. Jason became extremely upset. I reminded him that that the office I work for has a 24-hour cancelation policy and that he was welcome to discuss any questions he had about the policy with the directors at the office. Jason was still upset and said something to the effect of "If I have to pay for your time, then I'm going to use that time. Teach me the lesson you had planned for Russell." So I did. About 45 minutes later, Russell got home and I spent the remaining part of our session teaching Russell.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/13/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/12/">What are the various ways to loop in Ruby and how can you decide which is best to use?</a></h3>
    <p>There are many ways to loop in Ruby. Below are some of the more common options.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <codein>#each</codein>
            <code>
                <grn>[collection]</grn>.each do |element|
                <br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                <grn>[some code]</grn>
                <br/>end</code>
            <p>The
                <codein>
                    <grn>[collection]</grn>
                </codein>is often an array but can also be a range, e.g. (1..100), or a hash.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/12/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/11/">Giving and Receiving Feedback</a></h3>
    <p>Sophomore year of college, I took a math class called "Analysis". I had already taken a course called "Intro to Analysis", but even so Analysis basically killed me. The problem sets were designed to be particularly challenging, so most of the class would gather in the math building several times a week to try to solve the problems together. It was pretty intense. One night we all brought sleeping bags (and donuts) and spent the night. Our professor found us all happily snuggled up on the classroom floor the following morning. It was actually pretty awesome. Don't lie; I know you are secretly jealous.
    </p>
    <p>Ever since that class, I have loved solving problems in a group. It is truly remarkable how far beyond my comfort zone I can be pushed when put under pressure with other people who are equally motivated to solve problems. I have found that discussing problems with people who approach them in completely different ways than I do is one of the most productive ways to make progress. Moreover, the moments of success are magnified because I get to share them with other people. Basically, everything about it rocks.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/11/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/10/">Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</a></h3>
    <p>Before we talk about JavaScript, consider the following two questions.</p>
    <div class="indent">
        <h4><b>Who are web developers these days?</b>
        </h4>
        <p>Web developers can be, and are, just about anyone. Many are people who have simply had an idea for an application or website and are trying implement it. Such people come from an enormous variety of backgrounds. Some may have programming experience, but many don't.</p></div>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/10/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
