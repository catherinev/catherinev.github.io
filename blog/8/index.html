  <h3>Classes in Ruby</h3>
  <p>
        <em>Classes</em>are a natural way to group similar types of objects in Ruby. For example,
        <codein>Array</codein> is a class. There are two ways to define a new object in the class
        <codein>Array</codein> :
        <code>
            arr_1 = Array.new</br>
            arr_1[0] = "Hello"</br>
            arr_1[1] = "world"</br>
            arr_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
        </code>
        <codein>arr_1</codein> has been defined using constructor notation and
        <codein>arr_2</codein> has been defined using literal notation, but both are the same type of object.
        <codein>arr_1</codein> and
        <codein>arr_2</codein> are called
        <em>instances</em>of the class
        <codein>Array</codein>. So a class is a category, and an instance is a particular object that falls into that category. Other examples of classes are
        <codein>String, Fixnum, Float,</codein> and
        <codein>Hash</codein>.</p>

    <p>So why are classes helpful? Because we often want to know similar things or perform similar tasks on objects in the same class. Each class has associated
        <em>methods</em>that do something to an instance of the class. For example,
        <codein>#length, #each,</codein> and
        <codein>#sort</codein> are all methods associated with the class
        <codein>Array</codein>. Similarly,
        <codein>#length, #downcase,</codein> and
        <codein>#each_char</codein> are all methods associated with the class
        <codein>String</codein>. Each of these methods can be called on any instance of the associated class. (Note that some methods are associated with more than one class.)</p>


    <p>All the above examples of classes come with Ruby. But it is also possible to define your own classes and associated methods. It is a good idea to create a new class of objects any time you think you will be creating multiple
        <em>instances</em>of that object and may want to perform the same tasks (i.e. call the same method) on those instances.</p>

    <p>For example, you may want to define the class
        <codein>Rectangle</codein> :</p>
    <code>
        class Rectangle</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(width, height)</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@width = width</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@height = height</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;end</br>
        </br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;def perimeter</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 * @width + 2 * @height</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;end</br>
        </br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;def area</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@width * @height</br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;end</br>
        end</br>
        </br>
        rec = Rectangle.new(3, 4)
    </code>
    <p>Above,
        <codein>rec</codein> is an instance of the class
        <codein>Rectangle</codein>.
        <p>It is natural to create a class for
            <codein>Rectangle</codein> because there are many possible instances of the class that can now all use the same methods.</p>
        <p>The first method we have is
            <codein>#initialize</codein>. This method is run automatically every time you create a new instance of the class. In our
            <codein>Rectangle</codein> example, all that the initialize method is doing is defining the
            <em>instance variables</em>
            <codein>@width</codein> and
            <codein>@height</codein>. An instance variable is a variable associated with an instance of the object and always begins with
            <codein>@</codein>. Instance variables can be used in any method within the class in which they are defined. In
            <codein>rec, @width = 3</codein> and
            <codein>@height = 4</codein> , so any
            <codein>Rectangle</codein> method that we call on
            <codein>rec</codein> will use the values 3 and 4 for
            <codein>@width</codein> and
            <codein>@height</codein> , respectively.</p>

        <p>After
            <codein>#initialize</codein> , we defined methods to find the perimeter and area of a rectangle. They can be called as follows:</p>
        <code>rec.perimeter
            <em>=> 14</em>
            </br>rec.area
            <em>=> 12</em>
        </code>
        <p>This is a brief introduction to classes set in the context of a fairly simple example, but hopefully it gives you a sense of what classes are and when they should be used.</p>
