    <h3><a href="/blog/5/"><codein>#map</codein> in Ruby</a></h3>
    <p>The <codein>#map</codein> method in Ruby can used to transform arrays, hashes, and ranges by calling a block of code on each element and pushing each result to a new array. So, regardless of the class of the input (array, hash, or range), the output is a new array.
    </p>

    <code>
        input.map { |item| block }
        <em>=> output_array</em>
    </code>
    <p>You can interpret this syntax as follows.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/5/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/4/">Pairing, Group Work, and Feedback</a></h3>
    <h4>Pairing and Group Work</h4>
    <p>Sophomore year of college, I took a math class called "Analysis". I had already taken a course called "Intro to Analysis", but even so Analysis basically killed me. The problem sets were designed to be particularly challenging, so most of the class would gather in the math building several times a week to try to solve the problems together. It was pretty intense. One night we all brought sleeping bags (and donuts) and spent the night. Our professor found us all happily snuggled up on the classroom floor the following morning. It was actually pretty awesome. Don't lie; I know you are secretly jealous.
    </p>
    <p>Ever since that class, I have loved solving problems in a group. It is truly remarkable how far beyond my comfort zone I can be pushed when put under pressure with other people who are equally motivated to solve problems. I have found that discussing problems with people who approach them in completely different ways than I do is one of the most productive ways to make progress. Moreover, the moments of success are magnified because I get to share them with other people. Basically, everything about it rocks.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/4/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/3/">What are the various ways to loop in Ruby and how can you decide which is best to use?</a></h3>
    <p>There are many ways to loop in Ruby. Below are some of the more common options.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <codein>#each</codein> 
            <code>
                <grn>[collection]</grn>.each do |element|
                <br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                <grn>[some code]</grn>
                <br/>end</code>
            <p>The
                <codein>
                    <grn>[collection]</grn>
                </codein> is often an array but can also be a range, e.g. (1..100), or a hash.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/3/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/19/">Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</a></h3>
    <p>Before we talk about JavaScript, consider the following two questions.</p>
    <div class="indent">
        <h4><b>Who are web developers these days?</b>
        </h4>
        <p>Web developers can be, and are, just about anyone. Many are people who have simply had an idea for an application or website and are trying implement it. Such people come from an enormous variety of backgrounds. Some may have programming experience, but many don't.</p></div>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/19/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Because many of my values are tightly connected to one another, I had a hard time picking just one word for this response. I settled on "commitment" because ultimately, my sense of accomplishment, pride, enthusiasm, and excitment are always a result of just how committed I have been to begin with. Commitment is important to me because of the sense of connection it implies. I have been committed to other people through friendship and love; I have been committed to solving tough problems; I have been committed to achieving excellent results at work. For all of these examples, there is a deep sense of connection and engagement either with other people, problems, or goals. No matter the context, my sense of achievement and pride is a direct result of how invested I've been rather than the outcome itself.</p>
        <p>While commitment is one of the foremost qualities that comes to mind when considering my happiest and proudest moments, it is also a word that comes to mind when I considering my most frustrating and unhappy moments. It is extremely discouraging, and sometimes downright miserable, when you are committed to a person, a problem, or a challenge that for whatever reason things don't work out as you are hoping or expecting.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/2/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
