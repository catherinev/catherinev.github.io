  <h3>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h3>
  <p>One reason I haven't felt particularly threatened by stereotypes is that I value personal achievement, improvement, and challenge above what other people think of me. Thus, it's easy to disregard stereotypes in favor of more objective measures of my ability and potential.</p>
    <p>I also strongly value the close relationships I have with others. During times of stress, I find comfort in such relationships not because of any encouraging words or favorable opinions but rather because of the shared experiences, closeness, and comfort they provide. I have been able to work through some of my most trying moments by helping others work through their own challenges and achieve their own successes.</p>
    <p>In moments of doubt at DBC, I think it will be important for me to focus on a few things. First, I shouldn't compare myself to others: I have my own standards for myself, and everyone at DBC has a different background and different goals. Instead of focusing on other people, I should focus on achieving
        <em>my</em>maximum potential in the time we have. Second, I should honestly evaluate myself. What have I done well? What is causing my self-doubt? Is it fair to judge myself so harshly for struggling with such a concept? What can I do to move past this moment? The last thing I should keep in mind is that I have (and will hopefully continue to build) strong relationships on which I can rely for support.</p>
    <p>My goal is to get as much out of DBC as I personally am able to. Through the prep phase and Phase 0 (thus far), I have had some moments when I felt great and totally confident in my ability to learn so much material so quickly and other moments when I felt overwhelmed, incompetent, and inadequate. But so far I've been able to overcome the tough moments, and as long as I do my best and evaluate myself according to my own standards, I'm sure I'll continue to succeed.</p>
