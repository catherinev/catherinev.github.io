        <p>Because many of my values are tightly connected to one another, I had a hard time picking just one word for this response. I settled on "commitment" because ultimately, my sense of accomplishment, pride, enthusiasm, and excitment are always a result of just how committed I have been to begin with. Commitment is important to me because of the sense of connection it implies. I have been committed to other people through friendship and love; I have been committed to solving tough problems; I have been committed to achieving excellent results at work. For all of these examples, there is a deep sense of connection and engagement either with other people, problems, or goals. No matter the context, my sense of achievement and pride is a direct result of how invested I've been rather than the outcome itself.</p>
        <p>While commitment is one of the foremost qualities that comes to mind when considering my happiest and proudest moments, it is also a word that comes to mind when I considering my most frustrating and unhappy moments. It is extremely discouraging, and sometimes downright miserable, when you are committed to a person, a problem, or a challenge that for whatever reason things don't work out as you are hoping or expecting.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/9/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h4>A few thoughts on object oriented programming</h4>
    <p>We spent all of Monday and Tuesday covering object oriented programming and good design principles. It was a lot to take in over the course of just two days, and by Tuesday night I was pretty exhausted. There's no way that I'll be able to cover everything in this blog post, so I'll just mention some highlights.</p>
    <p>First, <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">POODR</a> is amazing, and Sandi Metz is a fantastic writer. If you don't have time to read the whole book, check out the <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3358-railsconf-all-the-little-things">talk</a> she gave at RailsConf earlier this year.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/8/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h4>10 topics I learned about this week</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular Expressions</li>

        <li>Recursion</li>
        <li>Memoization</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Regular Expressions</h4>
    <p>I wrote an earlier post on regular expressions that can be found <a href="week9_technical.html">here</a>. This week, I learned much more about the
        <codein>#gsub</codein>method and how to use it. The website <a href="http://rubular.com/">Rubular</a> is a great tool for testing regular expressions in Ruby.</p>
    <p>
        <codein>#gsub</codein>is used to find and replace text using regular expressions. For example, suppose you have decided you want to change the format of all dates from MM-DD-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD. The following code can be implemented on your text to make that substitution.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/7/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/6/">Some reflections on Phase 2</a></h3>
    <p>First, apologies for not posting more over the past few weeks. Phase 2 was pretty intense. But I have a bit of a break this evening and am hoping to post a few of the things I've worked on!</p>


    <p>Despite the long hours, I really enjoyed phase 2. The first week was pretty stressful, and I constantly felt behind. But partway through the second week I realized that I was learning more each day than I ever have before. I didn't even know I was capable of fitting so much new information into my brain at one time. So even though I still feel like I have a long way to go before mastering the material, I am really proud of how much I have learned.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/6/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/5/">Group Projects</a></h3>
    <p>To be perfectly honest, the real reason I want to write this post is so I can show off the amazing website my group made last weekend. I think everyone can agree it has the best web design seen since the late 90s.</p>

    <div style="margin: 5px auto; width: 420px">
        <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HNmW_cGrHSQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>As long as I'm writing this post, I might as well take the opportunity to mention group work at DBC. Each week we are assigned a new group of 3-4 people. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, each group splits into pairs and the pairs work on core challenges. Thursday is assessment day/optional pairing day (after assessment, we can choose to pair or work solo). On Friday, the whole group comes together to work on one big project. The projects have included writing a Sudoku solver, a flashcard app, a To-Do list application, and our own version of Survey Monkey (see excellent results above).</p></div>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/5/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
