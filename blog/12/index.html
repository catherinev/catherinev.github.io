  <h3>Giving and Receiving Feedback</h3>
  <p>Sophomore year of college, I took a math class called "Analysis".  I had already taken a course called "Intro to Analysis", but even so Analysis basically killed me.  The problem sets were designed to be particularly challenging, so most of the class would gather in the math building several times a week to try to solve the problems together.  It was pretty intense.  One night we all brought sleeping bags (and donuts) and spent the night.  Our professor found us all happily snuggled up on the classroom floor the following morning.  It was actually pretty awesome.  Don't lie; I know you are secretly jealous.
			</p>
			<p>Ever since that class, I have loved solving problems in a group.  It is truly remarkable how far beyond my comfort zone I can be pushed when put under pressure with other people who are equally motivated to solve problems.  I have found that discussing problems with people who approach them in completely different ways than I do is one of the most productive ways to make progress.  Moreover, the moments of success are magnified because I get to share them with other people.  Basically, everything about it rocks.</p>

			<p>Now, before DBC most of the group work I've participated in has been with people who have self-selected into the group.  No need to come to group homework sessions if you are so brilliant that you can solve the problems on your own.  Therefore, I really haven't had to deal with people who haven't wanted to be (or didn't learn how to be) part of a group.</p>
			<p>This remains one of my primary concerns about pair programming--working with people who don't know how to (or particularly want to) work with someone else.  Although I have minimal experience with pair programming, I have a few friends who have been in CS for years and had terrible experiences with pair programming: her partner doesn't communicate; he talks down to her; he treats her like she's an idiot even though he's doing something wrong.</p>
			<p>Despite these concerns, the pair programming sessions I have done recently have been really positive.  The sessions held all the same appeal as my Analysis homework sessions: the moments of success were shared achievements, and I believe my partner and I exchanged useful knowledge and skills. In some sessions, I think the communication could have been better, but not necessarily for lack of effort so much as for lack of experience.</p>
			<p>Because of this, I'm feeling much less apprehensive about pairing at DBC.  I hope to continue to get to know and problem solve with more people in my cohort.</p>

			<p>As psyched as I am about pair programming, I am equally thrilled to be giving and receiving feedback.  One of the difficulties I have had in past jobs is not knowing how well I am doing or how I can improve.  In response, I often reflect on my own progress, or lack thereof, and consider ways in which I can improve.</p>

			<p>But nothing compares to candid outside opinions.  People see me and my work differently than I do, and these differences provide the potential for extremely useful feedback and criticism.</p>

			<p>My biggest meta-criticism is that people aren't being harsh enough in the feedback I've received.  I'll grant that it's tough because no one knows each other very well, so it seems like people are treading softly. But let's be real--I started programming a few months ago; there's no way my stuff is that good.  I would love to know if someone notices something that could be even slightly improved about my code or design.  I would also love to know if people find something about my demeanor during pairing to be offputting, overbearing, confusing, etc. Hopefully, as we all get to know each other a bit better, we will be more comfortable being honest and reflective with one another.</p>

			<p>Giving feedback is something I've reflected on a lot in the past few months.  One of my responsibilities at my current job is to train new employees, and I am also expected to give them feedback.  When I first started training, I found it difficult to give people I barely knew feedback that was both kind and honest.  But with time, I have realized a few things.  First, people really do appreciate honest feedback.  Second, feedback is kindest if you stick to the facts and avoid using adjectives and adverbs.  I try not to incorporate my feelings and instead just reiterate what happened. It's not always easy and often takes a great deal of thought, but I think the value of good feedback is worth the effort it can require.</p>
