  <h3>Group Projects</h3>
  <p>To be perfectly honest, the real reason I want to write this post is so I can show off the amazing website my group made last weekend.  I think everyone can agree it has the best web design seen since the late 90s.</p>

			<div style = "margin: 5px auto; width: 420px"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HNmW_cGrHSQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

			<p>As long as I'm writing this post, I might as well take the opportunity to mention group work at DBC.  Each week we are assigned a new group of 3-4 people.  On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, each group splits into pairs and the pairs work on core challenges.  Thursday is assessment day/optional pairing day (after assessment, we can choose to pair or work solo).  On Friday, the whole group comes together to work on one big project.  The projects have included writing a Sudoku solver, a flashcard app, a To-Do list application, and our own version of Survey Monkey (see excellent results above). </p>

			<p>In the past, I have <a href = "week3_cultural_blog.html">blogged</a> about how much I enjoy working in groups, and I consider myself to have a reasonable amount of experience working with others. Still, DBC has taught me some important collaborating skills specific to managing software development projects.  In phase 2, our instructors introduced Scrum and agile software development.  Since learning those techniques, the groups I've been in have used them on every project, and I think we've all been really happy with how effective the methodologies were at facilitating progress and communication.  Certain parts of the project -- such as designing and migrating the database tables -- we generally do together as a group.  But after we have established the user stories, agreed on the overall design, and set up the database, we break out to work solo or in pairs on smaller tasks.  Scrum has been key to keeping the group on track while allowing individuals to work on small tasks.</p>

			<p>Another fundamental part of group work has been using git.  At first, I was a bit daunted by all the things that could go wrong with git.  I still remember how I felt the first time we got a merge conflict--we had no idea what to do.  Happily, I think our cohort has gotten past that fear, and I absolutely love git.  I wish I had known about it sooner; it's value is not limited to programming projects.</p>
