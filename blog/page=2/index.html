    <h3><a href="/blog/26/">Don't Park There Chicago: the design</a></h3>
    <h4>See <a href = "/blog/24/">this post</a> for more background on the Don't Park There Chicago</h4>
  <p>The overall design of <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a> went through 3 distinct phases.  The first looked like this:</p>
  <h4 style = "text-align:center">Design 1</h4>
  <img src="/assets/dptc1.png" style="width: 70%; margin: 0 15% 2% 15%">
  <p>It's pretty snazzy looking.  However, it had a few problems.  The first was that the background picture was a large file that took a while to load.  We could probably have decreased the size of the file, but there was a bigger problem: the design impeded the functionality of the site.  At the bottom of the page was a super cool map and more information about street sweeping -- information that is valuable to many users.  Users must either scroll down or click the down arrow button to get that information.  But user testing revealed that almost no one scrolled or clicked the button.  We needed to redesign the site with functionality in mind.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/26/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/25/">Don't Park There Chicago: the database</a></h3>
    <h4>See <a href = "/blog/24/">this post</a> for more background on the Don't Park There Chicago</h4>

  <p>The data that backs <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a> is available in the City of Chicago Data Portal, specifically at <a href ="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Sanitation/Map-Street-Sweeping-2014/czxu-ejis">this</a> site. The dataset includes all the information we needed to make the site -- geospatial encoding of each street sweeping region and the corresponding street sweeping dates for 2014.  Before our app could do anything useful, we had to figure out how to harness the data from the data portal. After doing some research, we decided to store the data into a PostgreSQL database supported by PostGIS, an extension that allows PostgreSQL to store geospatial data and provides query support for that data.  Although we hadn't used PostGIS before, the documentation was great, so we were able to figure out how to use it pretty quickly.</p>

  <p>However, getting the data from the data portal to our own database did not go smoothly.  The data portal provides several different options for the format of the data: Shapefile, KML, and KMZ.  Theoretically, it should have been easy to import the Shapefile directly into our database.  However, when we imported the Shapefile, none of the geospatial queries yielded the expected results.  Part of the issue was that the data in our database was encoded, so it was difficult to tell why the queries weren't behaving as expected.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/25/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/24/">Don't Park There Chicago</a></h3>
    <p>I officially graduated from DBC just over a week ago.  It was so exciting!</p>
  <p>For the last 8 days of bootcamp, everyone works on a final project.  I was part of a team with 5 awesome people, and we built an app that I think came out pretty great: <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a>.  The app informs users of street sweeping dates in their areas and uses geospatial data about Chicago's 888 street sweeping regions to render an interactive Leaflet map.  Users may also sign up for email notifications (powered by Mandrill) or text notifications (powered by Twilio) to avoid being ticketed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/24/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/23/">My First Rails App!</a></h3>
    <p>During phase 2, we used a framework called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_(software)">Sinatra</a>, which is a lightweight version of Rails. Since it doesn't handle as many of the details as Rails does, it's a great way to get familiar with what is happening behind the scenes before jumping into Rails.</p>

    <p>I'm starting Phase 3 next week, so in preparation we learned Rails this weekend. The core assignment was to build a blog application. This is what I ended up with: <a href="http://theawesomeblogger.herokuapp.com/">The Awesome Blogger</a>. If you want to see a blog without logging in, check out <a href="http://theawesomeblogger.herokuapp.com/users/1/articles">this link</a>. You'll find the posts to be thrilling. If you are interested in the source code for the site, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/catherinev/blog-app">here</a>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/23/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/22/">Group Projects</a></h3>
    <p>To be perfectly honest, the real reason I want to write this post is so I can show off the amazing website my group made last weekend. I think everyone can agree it has the best web design seen since the late 90s.</p>

    <div style="margin: 5px auto; width: 420px">
        <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HNmW_cGrHSQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>As long as I'm writing this post, I might as well take the opportunity to mention group work at DBC. Each week we are assigned a new group of 3-4 people. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, each group splits into pairs and the pairs work on core challenges. Thursday is assessment day/optional pairing day (after assessment, we can choose to pair or work solo). On Friday, the whole group comes together to work on one big project. The projects have included writing a Sudoku solver, a flashcard app, a To-Do list application, and our own version of Survey Monkey (see excellent results above).  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/22/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
