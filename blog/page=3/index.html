    <h4>A few thoughts on object oriented programming</h4>
    <p>We spent all of Monday and Tuesday covering object oriented programming and good design principles. It was a lot to take in over the course of just two days, and by Tuesday night I was pretty exhausted. There's no way that I'll be able to cover everything in this blog post, so I'll just mention some highlights.</p>
    <p>First, <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">POODR</a> is amazing, and Sandi Metz is a fantastic writer. If you don't have time to read the whole book, check out the <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3358-railsconf-all-the-little-things">talk</a> she gave at RailsConf earlier this year.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/20/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h4>Regular Expressions</h4>
    <p>I wrote an earlier post on regular expressions that can be found <a href="/blog/15/">here</a>. This week, I learned much more about the
        <codein>#gsub</codein> method and how to use it. The website <a href="http://rubular.com/">Rubular</a> is a great tool for testing regular expressions in Ruby.</p>
    <p>
        <codein>#gsub</codein> is used to find and replace text using regular expressions. For example, suppose you have decided you want to change the format of all dates from MM-DD-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD. The following code can be implemented on your text to make that substitution.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/18/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/17/">Day 5</a></h3>
    <p>It's the end of the first week, and I made it through! The week has been a bit of a roller coaster. It started out great, but I got really stuck on Wednesday night and had a hard time getting started on Thursday morning. On Thursday I also spent a large portion of the day working on projects independently--this is unusual for DBC since all other days of the week we are required to pair program on all challenges. The independent work was pretty good, but we had some tough problems to work on in the afternoon and I got stuck. To give my mind a break, I walked around to see what other people were working on, which was incredibly helpful and gave me the opportunity to talk with some of the members of my cohort I haven't worked with yet. For the rest of the night, I worked with Tyler on the remaining projects, and I think we did an awesome job.</p>
    <p>We started really diving into rspec this week, which is a powerful tool but I don't feel that I have a full grasp on its capabilities. We also covered recursion on Wednesday, which was totally awesome and super fun. Today we are writing a program to solve Sudoku. All the more advanced cohorts have warned us we'll be working on it for pretty much the whole weekend.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/17/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/15/">Regular Expressions</a></h3>
    <h4>What are regular expressions?</h4>
    <p>Regular expressions, or RegExp, are used to search a string for a particular pattern of characters. The search can be simple ("does the string contain 'Maru'?") or somewhat more complex ("does the string contain a 0 or 1 followed by any sequence of four numbers followed by lower-case letters?").</p>

    <h4>A simple example in Ruby</h4>
    <p>Suppose we want to know if a particular string contains 'Maru':  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/15/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
