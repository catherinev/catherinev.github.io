  <h3>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h3>
  <p>Before we talk about JavaScript, consider the following two questions.</p>
			<div class = "indent">
				<h4><b>Who are web developers these days?</b></h4>
				<p>Web developers can be, and are, just about anyone.  Many are people who have simply had an idea for an application or website and are trying implement it.  Such people come from an enormous variety of backgrounds.  Some may have programming experience, but many don't.  </p>
				<h4><b>What are web developers developing?</b></h4>
				<p>In the past, websites were largely static--they just presented information.  Not so anymore.  Think about smartphones, tablets, and how you interact with the web from your computer these days.  You can check the weather, play games, see how much money you have in your checking account, pay a bill, track your calorie intake, find out how soon the bus will arrive, buy a book, book a flight...</p>
				<p>There are some common features among these examples.  Information on websites and in web apps often changes frequently--the weather, the score of a basketball game, the latest news stories, etc.  People also experience the web in much more interactive ways than they have in the past--playing games, buying things, paying bills, and so on.</p>
			</div>
			<p>With the answers to these questions in mind, let's look at some of the characteristics that inevitably draw web developers to JavaScript:</p>
			<p>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><h4>It's dynamic.</h4>
					<p>We mentioned above that many websites (and applications) aren't static anymore.  But HTML, the language that browsers can read and display, was build for static websites.  On it's own, HTML can't interact with users or be updated in real-time.  However, HTML does allow other types of objects to be <em>embedded</em> inside of it.  What does that mean?  Let's consider an analogy in a more familiar context.</p>
					<div class = "indent">
						<p>Microsoft Word is a word processor.  That means it was build so you could write stuff in it.  As a result, it's easy to compose, edit, and format text in MS Word.  Basically it's a fancy typewriter.</p>
						<p>But we have high standards these days.  No longer do we just write documents that  contain only text, we want to produce stuff that <em>looks good</em>.  For example, suppose I'm submitting a proposal at work and want to include the company logo on the coversheet.  I can write the proposal directly in MS Word, but I can't draw the logo in Word--I have to <em>insert</em> the logo as an image that has been made in a different program, such as Photoshop, which specializes in drawing stuff.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Just like we can <em>insert</em> images into MS Word files, we can <em>embed</em> scripts in HTML.  And just like Photoshop can be used to create images that can't be created in MS Word, JavaScript can be used to write scripts that can't be written in HTML.</p>
					<p> So what types of scripts do web developers write with JavaScript?  The ones that allow users to interact with websites: unlike HTML, JavaScript is <em>dynamic</em>.  Web developers often want to (or need to) include dynamic scripts in their websites and web apps these days.
				</li>
				<li><h4>It's popular.</h4>
					<p>This may seem like an unfilling explanation for why JavaScript is popular, but there are many consequences of JavaScript's popularity that make it especially attractive to web developers.  For example:
						<ul>
							<li>All mainstream browsers support it.  Therefore, pretty much anyone can use  websites or apps that include JavaScript.  This allows for an excellent user experience.</li>
							<li>There are many online tutorials and an enormous community from which to seek help.  So aspiring developers can easily teach themselves the language and seek out help if they have specific questions.  This is particularly valuable because many web developers have minimal programming experience.</li>
							<li>There are many libraries and frameworks freely available.  That means that web developers can save time by using or modifying code that someone else has already written (and freely shared).</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li><h4>It's a pretty simple language.</h4>
					<p>In other words, it's not that hard to learn.  Again, consider who web developers are: they can be anyone, not just people with a significant amount of programming experience.  It follows that a simple, easy-to-learn language is going to be a popular option, especially if it gets the job done and there is a sizeable community from which to seek help.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
