    <p>Before we talk about JavaScript, consider the following two questions.</p>
    <div class="indent">
        <h4><b>Who are web developers these days?</b>
        </h4>
        <p>Web developers can be, and are, just about anyone. Many are people who have simply had an idea for an application or website and are trying implement it. Such people come from an enormous variety of backgrounds. Some may have programming experience, but many don't.</p></div>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/19/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>Because many of my values are tightly connected to one another, I had a hard time picking just one word for this response. I settled on "commitment" because ultimately, my sense of accomplishment, pride, enthusiasm, and excitment are always a result of just how committed I have been to begin with. Commitment is important to me because of the sense of connection it implies. I have been committed to other people through friendship and love; I have been committed to solving tough problems; I have been committed to achieving excellent results at work. For all of these examples, there is a deep sense of connection and engagement either with other people, problems, or goals. No matter the context, my sense of achievement and pride is a direct result of how invested I've been rather than the outcome itself.</p>
        <p>While commitment is one of the foremost qualities that comes to mind when considering my happiest and proudest moments, it is also a word that comes to mind when I considering my most frustrating and unhappy moments. It is extremely discouraging, and sometimes downright miserable, when you are committed to a person, a problem, or a challenge that for whatever reason things don't work out as you are hoping or expecting.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/2/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/1/">Serious Eats</a></h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.seriouseats.com" target="_blank">Serious Eats</a> is one of my favorite websites. Like so many other websites, it has an excellent assortment of delicious recipes and reviews of restaurants all over the world. What sets it apart from other websites for me is primarily Kenji, one of the blog writers who has a background in science and writes excellent (and sometimes surprising) articles on the science behind his recipes. There are other fantastic contributors to the website, but I especially enjoy reading about Kenji's experimental process and, at the same time, learning some food science. Who doesn't want to know why their food tastes good?
    </p>
    <p>I find the user-experience to be quite enjoyable and the design to be streamlined and easy to look at. Like any good food website, the homepage is full of photos of food, to which a user's eyes are immediately drawn. The colors are light and undistracting, and there is an appropriate amount of contrast between text and backgrounds. The website is set up like a blog, with the most recent posts first.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/1/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
