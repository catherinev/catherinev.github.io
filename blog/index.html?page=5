    <p>During phase 2, we used a framework called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_(software)">Sinatra</a>, which is a lightweight version of Rails. Since it doesn't handle as many of the details as Rails does, it's a great way to get familiar with what is happening behind the scenes before jumping into Rails.</p>

    <p>I'm starting Phase 3 next week, so in preparation we learned Rails this weekend. The core assignment was to build a blog application. This is what I ended up with: <a href="http://theawesomeblogger.herokuapp.com/">The Awesome Blogger</a>. If you want to see a blog without logging in, check out <a href="http://theawesomeblogger.herokuapp.com/users/1/articles">this link</a>. You'll find the posts to be thrilling. If you are interested in the source code for the site, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/catherinev/blog-app">here</a>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/4/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/3/">Day 5</a></h3>
    <p>It's the end of the first week, and I made it through! The week has been a bit of a roller coaster. It started out great, but I got really stuck on Wednesday night and had a hard time getting started on Thursday morning. On Thursday I also spent a large portion of the day working on projects independently--this is unusual for DBC since all other days of the week we are required to pair program on all challenges. The independent work was pretty good, but we had some tough problems to work on in the afternoon and I got stuck. To give my mind a break, I walked around to see what other people were working on, which was incredibly helpful and gave me the opportunity to talk with some of the members of my cohort I haven't worked with yet. For the rest of the night, I worked with Tyler on the remaining projects, and I think we did an awesome job.</p>
    <p>We started really diving into rspec this week, which is a powerful tool but I don't feel that I have a full grasp on its capabilities. We also covered recursion on Wednesday, which was totally awesome and super fun. Today we are writing a program to solve Sudoku. All the more advanced cohorts have warned us we'll be working on it for pretty much the whole weekend.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/3/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/1/">Amazon</a></h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.seriouseats.com" target="_blank">Serious Eats</a> is one of my favorite websites. Like so many other websites, it has an excellent assortment of delicious recipes and reviews of restaurants all over the world. What sets it apart from other websites for me is primarily Kenji, one of the blog writers who has a background in science and writes excellent (and sometimes surprising) articles on the science behind his recipes. There are other fantastic contributors to the website, but I especially enjoy reading about Kenji's experimental process and, at the same time, learning some food science. Who doesn't want to know why their food tastes good?
    </p>
    <p>I find the user-experience to be quite enjoyable and the design to be streamlined and easy to look at. Like any good food website, the homepage is full of photos of food, to which a user's eyes are immediately drawn. The colors are light and undistracting, and there is an appropriate amount of contrast between text and backgrounds. The website is set up like a blog, with the most recent posts first.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/1/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
