  <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
  <p>As a girl who is (and always has been) reasonably good at math and science, I have always been aware of the corresponding stereotype.  However, I can't think of a time it has affected my achievement, which may be one of the primary reasons I was able to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in math.  Throughout my schooling, it did upset me if someone prejudged my abilities because of my gender, but I've always  focused on my own standards for myself and have been able to find people (both guys and girls) who were eager to work with me.  I think I have a pretty good grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses, so I generally disregard someone's opinion of me unless they know me pretty well or have seen examples of my work.</p>

			<p>Because I have seen the consequences of stereotype threat and also strive to be an empathetic and rational person, I actively try to not judge people.  I feel comfortable judging the quality of someone's work after reviewing it, but that isn't necessarily a perfect reflection of an individual's abilities, and, regardless, any judgements are independent of any group the individual might fall into.  When I hear others around me stereotyping a collegue or potential collegue, I try to guide the conversation in the direction of factual information about the individuals's work and ability and away from subjective and judgemental statements about the individual's identity.  Such topics are irrelevant. </p>
