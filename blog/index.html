    <h3><a href="/blog/23/">My First Rails App!</a></h3>
    <p>During phase 2, we used a framework called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_(software)">Sinatra</a>, which is a lightweight version of Rails. Since it doesn't handle as many of the details as Rails does, it's a great way to get familiar with what is happening behind the scenes before jumping into Rails.</p>

    <p>I'm starting Phase 3 next week, so in preparation we learned Rails this weekend. The core assignment was to build a blog application. This is what I ended up with: <a href="http://theawesomeblogger.herokuapp.com/">The Awesome Blogger</a>. If you want to see a blog without logging in, check out <a href="http://theawesomeblogger.herokuapp.com/users/1/articles">this link</a>. You'll find the posts to be thrilling. If you are interested in the source code for the site, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/catherinev/blog-app">here</a>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/23/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/22/">Group Projects</a></h3>
    <p>To be perfectly honest, the real reason I want to write this post is so I can show off the amazing website my group made last weekend. I think everyone can agree it has the best web design seen since the late 90s.</p>

    <div style="margin: 5px auto; width: 420px">

    </div>

    <p>As long as I'm writing this post, I might as well take the opportunity to mention group work at DBC. Each week we are assigned a new group of 3-4 people. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, each group splits into pairs and the pairs work on core challenges. Thursday is assessment day/optional pairing day (after assessment, we can choose to pair or work solo). On Friday, the whole group comes together to work on one big project. The projects have included writing a Sudoku solver, a flashcard app, a To-Do list application, and our own version of Survey Monkey (see excellent results above).  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/22/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/21/">Some reflections on Phase 2</a></h3>
    <p>First, apologies for not posting more over the past few weeks. Phase 2 was pretty intense. But I have a bit of a break this evening and am hoping to post a few of the things I've worked on!</p>


    <p>Despite the long hours, I really enjoyed phase 2. The first week was pretty stressful, and I constantly felt behind. But partway through the second week I realized that I was learning more each day than I ever have before. I didn't even know I was capable of fitting so much new information into my brain at one time. So even though I still feel like I have a long way to go before mastering the material, I am really proud of how much I have learned.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/21/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h4>A few thoughts on object oriented programming</h4>
    <p>We spent all of Monday and Tuesday covering object oriented programming and good design principles. It was a lot to take in over the course of just two days, and by Tuesday night I was pretty exhausted. There's no way that I'll be able to cover everything in this blog post, so I'll just mention some highlights.</p>
    <p>First, <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">POODR</a> is amazing, and Sandi Metz is a fantastic writer. If you don't have time to read the whole book, check out the <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3358-railsconf-all-the-little-things">talk</a> she gave at RailsConf earlier this year.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/20/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/18/">More Reflections on Week 1</a></h3>
    <h4>10 topics I learned about this week</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular Expressions</li>
        <li>Iteration</li>
        <li>Recursion</li>
        <li>Memoization</li>
        <li>RSpec</li>
        <li>Writing Readable Code: Style in Ruby</li>
        <li>Variable Scope</li>
        <li>Nested Arrays, the Object Heap, and Shallow Copies</li>
        <li>Debugging Tools (for example, Pry, which is awesome)</li>
        <li>Enumerable Methods</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Regular Expressions</h4>
    <p>I wrote an earlier post on regular expressions that can be found <a href="/blog/15/">here</a>. This week, I learned much more about the
        <codein>#gsub</codein> method and how to use it. The website <a href="http://rubular.com/">Rubular</a> is a great tool for testing regular expressions in Ruby.</p>
    <p>
        <codein>#gsub</codein> is used to find and replace text using regular expressions. For example, suppose you have decided you want to change the format of all dates from MM-DD-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD. The following code can be implemented on your text to make that substitution.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/18/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
