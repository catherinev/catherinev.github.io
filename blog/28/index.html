  <h3>Using LyX to Display Code: Part 1</h3>
  <h5 style="font-weight:bold">Prerequisites</h5>
  <aside><em>Note: the introduction to this tutorial can be found <a href="/blog/27/">here</a>.</em></aside><br>
  
  <h4>0. Mac OS X</h4>
  <p>As I mentioned in the intro, I have a Mac, so this tutorial will be specifically aimed at Mac OS X.  However, it may not be too hard to modify it for Linux (and possibly Windows), especially if you are familiar with LaTeX and how it is configured on your machine.</p>
  <h4>1. LaTeX</h4>
  <p>You need to have LaTeX install on your computer.  I strongly recommend downloading <a href = "https://tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a>, although other distributions are available.  The package we will be using, <codein>minted</codein>, requires several packages that are included MacTeX, as well as the editor TeXShop.  These are not all included in more basic distributions of TeX and could make the rest of the installation process much more challenging.</p>
  <p>If you already have TeXLive 2014 but are using a different text editor (not TeXShop), that's also fine.</p>
  <h4>2. LyX</h4>
  <p>LyX can be found at this website: <a href = "http://www.lyx.org/">http://www.lyx.org/</a></p>
  <h4>3. Python</h4>
  <p><codein>minted</codein> requires Python.  If you just downloaded LyX, you should be in good shape (it ships with a recent version of Python).  However, if you are using an old version of LyX, make sure you are running at least Python 2.6.  If you need to update, check out this site:  <a href = "https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>
  <h4>4. Pygments</h4>
  <p><codein>minted</codein> also requires Pygments, which can be installed with the following command:</p>
  <code>
    sudo easy_install Pygments
  </code>
  <p>If you already have Pygments, make sure you have at least version 1.2.</p>
