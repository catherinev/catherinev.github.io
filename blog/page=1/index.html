  <h5>0. Not Windows?</h5>
  <p>It's possible this tutorial can be easily adapted for Windows, but proceed with caution.  We will be using a LaTeX package called <codein>minted</codein>, and its documentation claims that "Windows support is sketchy / untested".  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/28/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h4>What is LyX?</h4>
  <p>Before we talk about LyX, let's talk briefly about <a href = "http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, which is a widely used markup language that is especially popular in math and the sciences.  I first fell in love with LaTeX when I was writing my math thesis in college.  Then I went to math grad school and wrote basically everything in TeX.  It just makes things look so pretty.</p>
  <p>Anyways, a few years ago a friend of mine introduced me to LyX.  <a href = "http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> is <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM">WYSIWYM</a> interface for LaTeX.  Even though LyX code still needs to be compiled, its interface reflects the compiled document much more closely than outright code does.  To be perfectly honest, I was happy with LaTeX just the way it was; I don't mind the fact that it's not WYSIWYG.  But it has a few distinct downsides:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/27/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/26/">Don't Park There Chicago: the design</a></h3>
    <h4>See <a href = "/blog/24/">this post</a> for more background on the Don't Park There Chicago</h4>
  <p>The overall design of <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a> went through 3 distinct phases.  The first looked like this:</p>
  <h4 style = "text-align:center">Design 1</h4>
  <img src="/assets/dptc1.png" style="width: 70%; margin: 0 15% 2% 15%">
  <p>It's pretty snazzy looking.  However, it had a few problems.  The first was that the background picture was a large file that took a while to load.  We could probably have decreased the size of the file, but there was a bigger problem: the design impeded the functionality of the site.  At the bottom of the page was a super cool map and more information about street sweeping -- information that is valuable to many users.  Users must either scroll down or click the down arrow button to get that information.  But user testing revealed that almost no one scrolled or clicked the button.  We needed to redesign the site with functionality in mind.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/26/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/25/">Don't Park There Chicago: the database</a></h3>
    <h4>See <a href = "/blog/24/">this post</a> for more background on the Don't Park There Chicago</h4>

  <p>The data that backs <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a> is available in the City of Chicago Data Portal, specifically at <a href ="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Sanitation/Map-Street-Sweeping-2014/czxu-ejis">this</a> site. The dataset includes all the information we needed to make the site -- geospatial encoding of each street sweeping region and the corresponding street sweeping dates for 2014.  Before our app could do anything useful, we had to figure out how to harness the data from the data portal. After doing some research, we decided to store the data into a PostgreSQL database supported by PostGIS, an extension that allows PostgreSQL to store geospatial data and provides query support for that data.  Although we hadn't used PostGIS before, the documentation was great, so we were able to figure out how to use it pretty quickly.</p>

  <p>However, getting the data from the data portal to our own database did not go smoothly.  The data portal provides several different options for the format of the data: Shapefile, KML, and KMZ.  Theoretically, it should have been easy to import the Shapefile directly into our database.  However, when we imported the Shapefile, none of the geospatial queries yielded the expected results.  Part of the issue was that the data in our database was encoded, so it was difficult to tell why the queries weren't behaving as expected.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/25/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/24/">Don't Park There Chicago</a></h3>
    <p>I officially graduated from DBC just over a week ago.  It was so exciting!</p>
  <p>For the last 8 days of bootcamp, everyone works on a final project.  I was part of a team with 5 awesome people, and we built an app that I think came out pretty great: <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a>.  The app informs users of street sweeping dates in their areas and uses geospatial data about Chicago's 888 street sweeping regions to render an interactive Leaflet map.  Users may also sign up for email notifications (powered by Mandrill) or text notifications (powered by Twilio) to avoid being ticketed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/24/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
