  <h4>0. Make sure <codein>minted</codein> is working in LaTeX and familiarize yourself with LyX</h4>
  <p>In other words, start by doing <a href="/blog/29/">part 2</a> of this tutorial.  Then, if you have not already used LyX, you should probably play around with it for a bit.  See what it can do.  Use different environments; generate a PDF of your document; change the font style; insert some math; maybe even insert a table (and see if you can customize it).  </p>

  <h4>1. Find the LyX source code files we are going to modify</h4>
  <p>We are going to add a new environment to the <codein>stdlayouts.inc</codein> file.  On a Mac, this file can be found at the following path: <codein>/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources/layouts</codein>.  From the Finder, you can access this by first opening the Applications folder, then right clicking LyX and selecting "Show Package Contents".  From there, select Contents then Resources then layouts, and you should find the desired file.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/30/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

  <h4>0. Mac OS X</h4>
  <p>As I mentioned in the intro, I have a Mac, so this tutorial will be specifically aimed at Mac OS X.  However, it may not be too hard to modify it for Linux (and possibly Windows), especially if you are familiar with LaTeX and how it is configured on your machine.</p>
  <h4>1. LaTeX</h4>
  <p>You need to have LaTeX install on your computer.  I strongly recommend downloading <a href = "https://tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a>, although other distributions are available.  The package we will be using, <codein>minted</codein>, requires several packages that are included MacTeX, as well as the editor TeXShop.  These are not all included in more basic distributions of TeX and could make the rest of the installation process much more challenging.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/28/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/27/">Using LyX to Display Code: Intro</a></h3>
    <h4>What is LyX?</h4>
  <p>Before we talk about LyX, let's talk briefly about <a href = "http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, which is a widely used markup language that is especially popular in math and the sciences.  I first fell in love with LaTeX when I was writing my math thesis in college.  Then I went to math grad school and wrote basically everything in TeX.  It just makes things look so pretty.</p>
  <p>Anyways, a few years ago a friend of mine introduced me to LyX.  <a href = "http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> is <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM">WYSIWYM</a> interface for LaTeX.  Even though LyX code still needs to be compiled, its interface reflects the compiled document much more closely than outright code does.  To be perfectly honest, I was happy with LaTeX just the way it was; I don't mind the fact that it's not WYSIWYG.  But it has a few distinct downsides:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/27/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>

    <h3><a href="/blog/26/">Don't Park There Chicago: the design</a></h3>
    <h4>See <a href = "/blog/24/">this post</a> for more background on the Don't Park There Chicago</h4>
  <p>The overall design of <a href = "http://dontparkthere.herokuapp.com">Don't Park There Chicago</a> went through 3 distinct phases.  The first looked like this:</p>
  <h4 style = "text-align:center">Design 1</h4>
  <img src="/assets/dptc1.png" style="width: 70%; margin: 0 15% 2% 15%">
  <p>It's pretty snazzy looking.  However, it had a few problems.  The first was that the background picture was a large file that took a while to load.  We could probably have decreased the size of the file, but there was a bigger problem: the design impeded the functionality of the site.  At the bottom of the page was a super cool map and more information about street sweeping -- information that is valuable to many users.  Users must either scroll down or click the down arrow button to get that information.  But user testing revealed that almost no one scrolled or clicked the button.  We needed to redesign the site with functionality in mind.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="rm" href="/blog/26/">read more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
