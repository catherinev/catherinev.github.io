  <h3>Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>
  <p>This week, our cohort watched a video lecture/Q&A given by Shereef Bishay, one of the founders of Dev Bootcamp. The video gave some insight into the culture at DBC and outlined broad expectations for its students. There were two key points made during the lecture that particularly resonated with me: that each of us is in charge of our own success and that we shouldn't compare ourselves to others. Both of these points are valuable beyond just DBC, but I'll reflect on them just in the context of the upcoming program.</p>

    <p>Shereef's metaphor of the "kitchen" (you make your food) versus "restaurant" (you order your food) was primarily valuable because it clearly outlined the expectations for us as students. Knowing that we are expected to take charge of our own education makes it easier for us all to do so. I find comfort knowing that I can make decisions to spend more or less time on topics depending on how valuable I think they will be. In fact, during Phase 0 I have sometimes found myself spending less time on certain topics or assignments that seemed less valuable to my education. Shereef's comments in the video make me feel more confident making those decisions.</p>

    <p>It was also nice to hear him acknowledge that DBC is still a work in progress. Based on the video, it's clear that teachers encourage feedback from their students and are constantly reflecting on how the curriculum and overall program can be improved. I especially thrive in open work environments that encourage constructive feedback.</p>

    <p>On a more personal note, the video helped me realize how important it will be for me to reach out to teachers and other students for feedback over the next few months. As someone with very little programming experience, I sometimes find it difficult to evaluate my work. And since we are not being "delivered" a pre-packaged program, I want to make sure I am getting the feedback I need to ensure that I develop good programming habits.</p>

    <p>Finally, Shereef emphasized the importance of focusing on our own improvement instead of comparing ourselves to each other. This is extremely important because of how closely we'll all be working. It's somewhat comforting to hear--from someone who has quite a bit of perspective--that even though it may feel to us like certain people are a lot more advanced than others, to him we all have just about the same amount of inexperience.</p>
