  <h3>Some reflections on Phase 2</h3>
  <p>First, apologies for not posting more over the past few weeks. Phase 2 was pretty intense. But I have a bit of a break this evening and am hoping to post a few of the things I've worked on!</p>


    <p>Despite the long hours, I really enjoyed phase 2. The first week was pretty stressful, and I constantly felt behind. But partway through the second week I realized that I was learning more each day than I ever have before. I didn't even know I was capable of fitting so much new information into my brain at one time. So even though I still feel like I have a long way to go before mastering the material, I am really proud of how much I have learned.</p>

    <p>Over the past few weeks, I have also realized how important it is for me to spend time working solo. Pair programming is a huge part of DBC and is a challenge in and of itself. But after 5pm, pairing is optional. Despite that, in phase 1 I almost always paired until we were done with the core assignments, regardless of how long that took. But during phase 2, I often finished assignments solo (or redid assignments solo). I think that mixing it up was really key to how comfortable I became with the material.</p>

    <p>The material itself was also fundamentally different from that of phase 1. During phase 1, we were learning lots of new stuff, but a lot of it boiled down to logic, which I am very comfortable with. We weren't building stuff; we were learning to how to think like programmers. On the other hand, in phase 2 we were building something new every day and learning new tools to make stuff more awesome. Because it felt like an onslaught of material, it took more effort for me to internalize the big ideas.</p>

    <p>Here are some of the topics we covered in phase 2:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ActiveRecord and Associations</li>
        <li>Ajax</li>
        <li>JavaScript, OO JavaScript</li>
        <li>JQuery</li>
        <li>CRUD apps</li>
        <li>RESTful routing</li>
        <li>Agile development</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>Twitter's API and OAuth</li>
        <li>The basics of deploying to Heroku</li>
    </ul>
